abstract = {A cell contains numerous protein molecules. One of the fundamental goals in molecular cell biology is to determine their subcellular locations since this information is extremely important to both basic research and drug development. In this paper, we report a novel and very powerful predictor called "pLoc{\_}bal-mHum" for predicting the subcellular localization of human proteins based on their sequence information alone. Cross-validation tests on exactly the same experiment-confirmed dataset have indicated that the new predictor is remarkably superior to the existing state-of-the-art predictor in identifying the subcellular localization of human proteins. To maximize the convenience for the majority of experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for the new predictor has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pLoc{\_}bal-mHum/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the detailed mathematics.},
