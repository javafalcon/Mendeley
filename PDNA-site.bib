abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many fundamental biological processes essential for cellular function. Most of the existing computational approaches employed only the sequence context of the target residue for its prediction. In the present study, for each target residue, we applied both the spatial context and the sequence context to construct the feature space. Subsequently, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was applied to remove the redundancies in the feature space. Finally, a predictor (PDNAsite) was developed through the integration of the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and ensemble learning. Results on the PDNA-62 and the PDNA-224 datasets demonstrate that features extracted from spatial context provide more information than those from sequence context and the combination of them gives more performance gain. An analysis of the number of binding sites in the spatial context of the target site indicates that the interactions between binding sites next to each other are important for protein-DNA recognition and their binding ability. The comparison between our proposed PDNAsite method and the existing methods indicate that PDNAsite outperforms most of the existing methods and is a useful tool for DNA-binding site identification. A web-server of our predictor (http://hlt.hitsz.edu.cn:8080/PDNAsite/) is made available for free public accessible to the biological research community.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding how biomolecules interact is a major task of systems biology. To model protein-nucleic acid interactions, it is important to identify the DNA or RNA-binding residues in proteins. Protein sequence features, including the biochemical property of amino acids and evolutionary information in terms of position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), have been used for DNA or RNA-binding site prediction. However, PSSM is rather designed for PSI-BLAST searches, and it may not contain all the evolutionary information for modelling DNA or RNA-binding sites in protein sequences.Results: In the present study, several new descriptors of evolutionary information have been developed and evaluated for sequence-based prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues using support vector machines (SVMs). The new descriptors were shown to improve classifier performance. Interestingly, the best classifiers were obtained by combining the new descriptors and PSSM, suggesting that they captured different aspects of evolutionary information for DNA and RNA-binding site prediction. The SVM classifiers achieved 77.3{\%} sensitivity and 79.3{\%} specificity for prediction of DNA-binding residues, and 71.6{\%} sensitivity and 78.7{\%} specificity for RNA-binding site prediction.Conclusions: Predictions at this level of accuracy may provide useful information for modelling protein-nucleic acid interactions in systems biology studies. We have thus developed a web-based tool called BindN+ (http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn+/) to make the SVM classifiers accessible to the research community. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Wang2006,
abstract = {BindN (http://bioinformatics.ksu.edu/bindn/) takes an amino acid sequence as input and predicts potential DNA or RNA-binding residues with support vector machines (SVMs). Protein datasets with known DNA or RNA-binding residues were selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and SVM models were constructed using data instances encoded with three sequence features, including the side chain pKa value, hydrophobicity index and molecular mass of an amino acid. The results suggest that DNA-binding residues can be predicted at 69.40{\%} sensitivity and 70.47{\%} specificity, while prediction of RNA-binding residues achieves 66.28{\%} sensitivity and 69.84{\%} specificity. When compared with previous studies, the SVM models appear to be more accurate and more efficient for online predictions. BindN provides a useful tool for understanding the function of DNA and RNA-binding proteins based on primary sequence data. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Although Deep learning algorithms have outperformed conventional methods in predicting the sequence specificities of DNA-protein binding, they lack to consider the dependencies among nucleotides and the diverse binding lengths for different transcription factors TFs. To address the above two limitations simultaneously, in this paper, we propose a high-order convolutional neural network architecture HOCNN, which employs a high-order encoding method to build high-order dependencies among nucleotides, and a multi-scale convolutional layer to capture the motif features of different length. The experimental results on real ChIP-seq datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning method DeepBind in the motif discovery task. In addition, we provide further insights about the importance of introducing additional convolutional kernels and the degeneration problem of importing high-order in the motif discovery task.},

abstract = {Identification of DNA–protein binding sites in protein sequence plays an essential role in a wide variety of biological processes. In particular, there are huge volumes of protein sequences accumulated in the post-genomic era. In this study, we propose a new prediction approach appropriate for imbalanced DNA–protein binding sites data. Specifically, motivated by the imbalanced problem of the distribution of DNA–protein binding and non-binding sites, we employ the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) approach to over-sample the positive data and Bootstrap strategy to under-sample the negative data to balance the number of the binding and non-binding samples. Furthermore, we employ the three types of features: the position specific scoring matrix, one-hot encoding and predicted solvent accessibility, to encode the sequence-based feature of each protein residue. In addition, we design an ensemble convolutional neural network classifier to handle the imbalance problem between binding and non-binding sites in protein sequence. Extensive experiments were conducted on the real DNA–protein binding sites dataset, PDNA-543, PDNA-224 and PDNA-316, in order to validate the effectiveness of our method on predicting the binding sites by ten-fold cross-validation metric. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a high prediction performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence-based DNA–protein binding sites predictors in terms of the Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Precision and Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Our method can obtain the MCC values of 0.63, 0.48 and 0.67 on PDNA-543, PDNA-224 and PDNA-316 datasets, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the art prediction models, the MCC values for our method are increased by at least 0.24, 0.13 and 0.23 on PDNA-543, PDNA-224 and PDNA-316 datasets, respectively.},

@article{Ahmad2004,
abstract = {Motivation: Though vitally important to cell function, the mechanism of protein-DNA binding has not yet been completely understood. We therefore analysed the relationship between DNA binding and protein sequence composition, solvent accessibility and secondary structure. Using non-redundant databases of transcription factors and protein-DNA complexes, neural network models were developed to utilize the information present in this relationship to predict DNA-binding proteins and their binding residues. Results: Sequence composition was found to provide sufficient information to predict the probability of its binding to DNA with nearly 69{\%} sensitivity at 64{\%} accuracy for the considered proteins; sequence neighbourhood and solvent accessibility information were sufficient to make binding site predictions with 40{\%} sensitivity at 79{\%} accuracy. Detailed analysis of binding residues shows that some three- and five-residue segments frequently bind to DNA and that solvent accessibility plays a major role in binding. Although, binding behaviour was not associated with any particular secondary structure, there were interesting exceptions at the residue level. Over-representation of some residues in the binding sites was largely lost at the total sequence level, but a different kind of compositional preference was observed in DNA-binding proteins. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Summary: This article describes DP-Bind, a web server for predicting DNA-binding sites in a DNA-binding protein from its amino acid sequence. The web server implements three machine learning methods: support vector machine, kernel logistic regression and penalized logistic regression. Prediction can be performed using either the input sequence alone or an automatically generated profile of evolutionary conservation of the input sequence in the form of PSI-BLAST position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). PSSM-based kernel logistic regression achieves the accuracy of 77.2{\%}, sensitivity of 76.4{\%} and specificity of 76.6{\%}. The outputs of all three individual methods are combined into a consensus prediction to help identify positions predicted with high level of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Background: Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many biological processes essential for cellular function. To understand the molecular mechanism of protein-DNA recognition, it is necessary to identify the DNA-binding residues in DNA-binding proteins. However, structural data are available for only a few hundreds of protein-DNA complexes. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data, it becomes an important but challenging task to accurately predict DNA-binding residues directly from amino acid sequence data. Results: A new machine learning approach has been developed in this study for predicting DNA-binding residues from amino acid sequence data. The approach used both the labelled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-DNA complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. The evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and several new descriptors. The sequence-derived features were then used to train random forests (RFs), which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. The use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RF classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset, and the predicted DNA-binding residues were examined in the context of three-dimensional structures. Conclusion: The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies. A new web server called BindN-RF http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn-rf/ has thus been developed to make the RF classifier accessible to the biological research community. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Compared with a recently published method, BindN+, our method predicts DNA-binding sites with a 7 better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value when tested on the same dataset.

abstract = {Background: Detection of DNA-binding sites in proteins is of enormous interest for technologies targeting gene regulation and manipulation. We have previously shown that a residue and its sequence neighbor information can be used to predict DNA-binding candidates in a protein sequence. This sequence-based prediction method is applicable even if no sequence homology with a previously known DNA-binding protein is observed. Here we implement a neural network based algorithm to utilize evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for a better prediction of DNA-binding sites. Results: An average of sensitivity and specificity using PSSMs is up to 8.7{\%} better than the prediction with sequence information only. Much smaller data sets could be used to generate PSSM with minimal loss of prediction accuracy. Conclusion: One problem in using PSSM-derived prediction is obtaining lengthy and timeconsuming alignments against large sequence databases. In order to speed up the process of generating PSSMs, we tried to use different reference data sets (sequence space) against which a target protein is scanned for PSI-BLAST iterations. We find that a very small set of proteins can actually be used as such a reference data without losing much of the prediction value. This makes the process of generating PSSMs very rapid and even amenable to be used at a genome level. A web server has been developed to provide these predictions of DNA-binding sites for any new protein from its amino acid sequence. {\textcopyright} 2005 Ahmad and Sarai; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},
