abstract = {Relational data has two characteristics: first, statistical dependencies exist between the entities we wish to model, and second, each entity often has a rich set of features that can aid classification. For example, when classifying Web documents, the pages text provides much information about the class label, but hyperlinks define a relationship between pages that can improve classification Taskar et al., 2002. Graphical models are a natural formalism for exploiting the dependence structure among entities. Traditionally, graphical models have been used to represent the joint probability distribution p(y, x), where the variables y represent the attributes of the entities that we wish to predict, and the input variables x represent our observed knowledge about the entities. But modeling the joint distribution can lead to difficulties when using the rich local features that can occur in relational data, because it requires modeling the distribution p(x), which can include complex dependencies. Modeling these dependencies among inputs can lead to intractable models, but ignoring them can lead to reduced performance. A solution to this problem is to directly model the conditional distribution p(yx), which is sufficient for classification. This is the approach taken by conditional random fields Lafferty et al., 2001. A conditional random field is simply a conditional distribution p(yx) with an associated graphical structure. Because the model is conditional, dependencies among the input variables x do not need to be explicitly represented, affording the use of rich, global features of the input. For example, in natural language tasks, useful features include neighboring words and word bigrams, prefixes and suffixes, capitalization, membership in domain-specific lexicons, and semantic information from sources such as WordNet. Recently there has been an explosion of interest in CRFs, with successful applications including text processing Taskar et al., 2002, Peng and McCallum, 2004, Settles, 2005, Sha and Pereira, 2003, bioinformatics Sato and Sakakibara, 2005, Liu et al., 2005, and computer vision He et al., 2004, Kumar and Hebert, 2003. This chapter is divided into two parts. First, we present a tutorial on current training and inference techniques for conditional random fields. We discuss the important special case of linear-chain CRFs, and then we generalize these to arbitrary graphical structures. We include a brief discussion of techniques for practical CRF implementations. Second, we present an example of applying a general CRF to a practical relational learning problem. In particular, we discuss the problem of information extraction, that is, automatically building a relational database from information contained in unstructured text. Unlike linear-chain models, general CRFs can capture long distance dependencies between labels. For example, if the same name is mentioned more than once in a document, all mentions probably have the same label, and it is useful to extract them all, because each mention may contain different complementary information about the underlying entity. To represent these long-distance dependencies, we propose a skip-chain CRF, a model that jointly performs segmentation and collective labeling of extracted mentions. On a standard problem of extracting speaker names from seminar announcements, the skip-chain CRF has better performance than a linear-chain CRF.},

abstract = {Investigation into the network of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) will provide valuable insights into the inner workings of cells. Accordingly, it is crucially important to develop an automated method or high-throughput tool that can efficiently predict the PPIs. In this study, a new predictor, called “iPPI-PseAAC(CGR)” was developed by incorporating the information of “chaos game representation” into the PseAAC (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition). The advantage by doing so is that some key sequence-order or sequence-pattern information can be more effectively incorporated during the treatment of the protein pair samples. The operation engine used in this predictor is the random forests algorithm. It has been observed via the cross-validations on the widely used benchmark datasets that the success rates achieved by the proposed predictor are remarkably higher than those by its existing counterparts. For the convenience of the most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for the new predictor has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPPI-PseAAC(CGR), by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the detailed mathematics.},

abstract = {Genetic engineering projects are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, driven by new tools to design and construct DNA. There is increasing concern that widened access to these technologies could lead to attempts to construct cells for malicious intent, illegal drug production, or to steal intellectual property. Determining the origin of a DNA sequence is difficult and time-consuming. Here deep learning is applied to predict the lab-of-origin of a DNA sequence. A convolutional neural network was trained on the Addgene plasmid dataset that contained 42,364 engineered DNA sequences from 2230 labs as of February 2016. The network correctly identifies the source lab 48{\%} of the time and 70{\%} it appears in the top 10 predicted labs. Often, there is not a single “smoking gun” that affiliates a DNA sequence with a lab. Rather, it is a combination of design choices that are individually common but collectively reveal the designer.},

abstract = {In addition to the typical random errors that vary between consecutive measurements, the measurements for most all sensors used for target tracking include bias errors that remain relatively fixed during a target tracking episode and are typically characterized by an a priori mean and covariance. Since the bias errors are approximately fixed during a tracking episode, those errors violate the typical assumption of the measurement errors being white noise. Inflating the measurement covariance of the random errors by adding the bias covariance gives track covariances that poorly represent the true errors. The Schmidt-Kalman filter can be used to prevent the track covariances from becoming artificially too small. However, the Schmidt-Kalman filter produces a track covariance that encompasses the random and bias errors. In this paper, the authors formulate the target tracking as a least-square estimation (LSE) problem and show that the track covariance due to the bias errors can be isolated from the track covariance due the random errors. The authors utilize Monte Carlo simulations to verify and illustrate the accuracy of isolation of the bias and random covariances.},

abstract = {Motivation: The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only.
Results: Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78{\%} for 10 categories; 92{\%} for membrane-bound or soluble), outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms, including those relying on homology information.
Availability and implementation: The method is available as a web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc. Example code is available at https://github.com/JJAlmagro/subcellular{\_}localization. The dataset is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc/data.php.

Recently, semi-supervised learning has received increasing attention among researchers. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called weighted inverse Laplacian (WIL), for predicting labels in partially labeled networks. The idea comes from the first hitting time in random walk, and it also has nice explanations both in information propagation and the regularization framework. We propose a partially labeled degree-corrected block model (pDCBM) to describe the generation of partially labeled networks. We show that WIL ensures the misclassification rate is of order {\$}O(\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}d{\}}){\$} for the pDCBM with average degree {\$}d=\backslashOmega(\backslashlog n),{\$} and that it can handle situations with greater unbalanced than traditional Laplacian methods.

To date, most recent graph embedding methods are mainly evaluated on social and information networks and have not been comprehensively studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization have shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding methods (e.g., random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art. We select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic comparison on three important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and two node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods which have not been explored completely on biomedical tasks achieve promising results and deserve more attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Besides, compared with three state-of-the-art methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any biological features. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks. We also develop an easy-to-use Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning is concerned with learning from data examples that are represented by a single feature vector while associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Existing multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations to facilitate the learning process. However, an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label learning, i.e., class-imbalance has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multi-label hypernetwork (TSMLHN) to exploit label correlations and to make use of them to address the class-imbalance problem in multi-label learning. In TSMLHN, labels of a multi-label data set are divided into two groups, i.e., imbalanced labels and common labels based on their imbalance ratios. In the first stage of TSMLHN, we train a multi-label hypernetwork (MLHN) which generates basic predictions for all labels. In the second stage of TSMLHN, we train TSMLHN based on the predictions obtained from MLHN and utilize the correlations between common labels and imbalanced labels to improve the learning performance of imbalanced labels. Our proposed TSMLHN is conceptually simple, yet it is effective in addressing the class-imbalance problem in multi-label learning. Empirical studies on a broad range of multi-label data sets demonstrate that TSMLHN achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms.},

We developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and demonstrated that PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to iteratively learn from 22 training cell types/tissues. Our results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} geometric mean (GM) of sensitivity and specificity across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues.

abstract = {Protein fold recognition is an important step towards understanding protein three-dimensional structures and their functions. A conditional graphical model, i.e., segmentation conditional random fields (SCRFs), is proposed as an effective solution to this problem. In contrast to traditional graphical models, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM), SCRFs follow a discriminative approach. Therefore, it is flexible to include any features in the model, such as overlapping or long-range interaction features over the whole sequence. The model also employs a convex optimization function, which results in globally optimal solutions to the model parameters. On the other hand, the segmentation setting in SCRFs makes their graphical structures intuitively similar to the protein 3-D structures and more importantly provides a framework to model the long-range interactions between secondary structures directly. Our model is applied to predict the parallel $\beta$-helix fold, an important fold in bacterial pathogenesis and carbohydrate binding/cleavage. The cross-family validation shows that SCRFs not only can score all known $\beta$-helices higher than non-$\beta$-helices in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but also accurately locates rungs in known beta-helix proteins. Our method outperforms BetaWrap, a state-of-the-art algorithm for predicting beta-helix folds, and HMMER, a general motif detection algorithm based on HMM, and has the additional advantage of general application to other protein folds. Applying our prediction model to the Uniprot Database, we identify previously unknown potential $\beta$-helices. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Relational data has two characteristics: first, statistical dependencies exist between the entities we wish to model, and second, each entity often has a rich set of features that can aid classification. For example, when classifying Web documents, the pages text provides much information about the class label, but hyperlinks define a relationship between pages that can improve classification Taskar et al., 2002. Graphical models are a natural formalism for exploiting the dependence structure among entities. Traditionally, graphical models have been used to represent the joint probability distribution p(y, x), where the variables y represent the attributes of the entities that we wish to predict, and the input variables x represent our observed knowledge about the entities. But modeling the joint distribution can lead to difficulties when using the rich local features that can occur in relational data, because it requires modeling the distribution p(x), which can include complex dependencies. Modeling these dependencies among inputs can lead to intractable models, but ignoring them can lead to reduced performance. A solution to this problem is to directly model the conditional distribution p(yx), which is sufficient for classification. This is the approach taken by conditional random fields Lafferty et al., 2001. A conditional random field is simply a conditional distribution p(yx) with an associated graphical structure. Because the model is conditional, dependencies among the input variables x do not need to be explicitly represented, affording the use of rich, global features of the input. For example, in natural language tasks, useful features include neighboring words and word bigrams, prefixes and suffixes, capitalization, membership in domain-specific lexicons, and semantic information from sources such as WordNet. Recently there has been an explosion of interest in CRFs, with successful applications including text processing Taskar et al., 2002, Peng and McCallum, 2004, Settles, 2005, Sha and Pereira, 2003, bioinformatics Sato and Sakakibara, 2005, Liu et al., 2005, and computer vision He et al., 2004, Kumar and Hebert, 2003. This chapter is divided into two parts. First, we present a tutorial on current training and inference techniques for conditional random fields. We discuss the important special case of linear-chain CRFs, and then we generalize these to arbitrary graphical structures. We include a brief discussion of techniques for practical CRF implementations. Second, we present an example of applying a general CRF to a practical relational learning problem. In particular, we discuss the problem of information extraction, that is, automatically building a relational database from information contained in unstructured text. Unlike linear-chain models, general CRFs can capture long distance dependencies between labels. For example, if the same name is mentioned more than once in a document, all mentions probably have the same label, and it is useful to extract them all, because each mention may contain different complementary information about the underlying entity. To represent these long-distance dependencies, we propose a skip-chain CRF, a model that jointly performs segmentation and collective labeling of extracted mentions. On a standard problem of extracting speaker names from seminar announcements, the skip-chain CRF has better performance than a linear-chain CRF.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

With publicly available datasets, we designed and trained various ConvNet architectures. We tested several recent deep learning techniques including wide residual networks, dropouts, and dilated convolutions. We studied the improvements in the precision of medium-range and long-range contacts, and compared the performance of our best architectures with the ones used in existing state-of-the-art methods.

When trained using the DeepCov dataset consisting of 3,456 proteins and tested on PSICOV dataset of 150 proteins, our architectures achieve up to 15{\%} higher precision when L/2 long-range contacts are evaluated.

It maintains an exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However, because the targets change only once per epoch, Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose Mean Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35{\%} on SVHN with 250 labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance.

abstract = {Motivation: Various bacterial pathogens can deliver their secreted substrates also called effectors through Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) into host cells and cause diseases. Since T3SS secreted effectors (T3SEs) play important roles in pathogen'host interactions, identifying them is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of T3SSs. However, the effectors display high level of sequence diversity, therefore making the identification a difficult process. There is a need to develop a novel and effective method to screen and select putative novel effectors from bacterial genomes that can be validated by a smaller number of key experiments. Results: We develop a deep convolution neural network to directly classify any protein sequence into T3SEs or non-T3SEs, which is useful for both effector prediction and the study of sequence-function relationship. Different from traditional machine learning-based methods, our method automatically extracts T3SE-related features from a protein N-Terminal sequence of 100 residues and maps it to the T3SEs space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from 16 species, yielding an average classification accuracy of 83.7{\%} in the 5-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 92.6{\%} for the test set. Moreover, when comparing with known state-of-The-Art prediction methods, the accuracy of our method is 6.31-20.73{\%} higher than previous methods on a common independent dataset. Besides, we visualize the convolutional kernels and successfully identify the key features of T3SEs, which contain important signal information for secretion. Finally, some effectors reported in the literature are used to further demonstrate the application of DeepT3.},

abstract = {Motivation: The computational identification of non-coding RNA regions on the genome is currently receiving much attention. However, it is essentially harder than gene-finding problems for protein-coding regions because non-coding RNA sequences do not have strong statistical signals. Since comparative sequence analysis is effective for non-coding RNA detection, efficient computational methods are expected for structural alignment of RNA sequences. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish the structural alignment tasks for RNA sequences, and we found that one of the most important points is to estimate an accurate score matrix for calculating structural alignments. Results: We propose a novel approach for RNA structural alignment based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach has some specific features compared with previous methods in the sense that the parameters for structural alignment are estimated such that the model can most probably discriminate between correct alignments and incorrect alignments, and has the generalization ability so that a satisfiable score matrix can be obtained even with a small number of sample data without overfitting. Experimental results clearly show that the parameter estimation with CRFs can outperform all the other existing methods for structural alignments of RNA sequences. Furthermore, structural alignment search based on CRFs is more accurate for predicting non-coding RNA regions than the other scoring methods. These experimental results strongly support our discriminative method employing CRFs to estimate the score matrix parameters. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, sequence comparison may lead to creation and propagation of function assignment errors. Thus, it is important to perform a thorough analysis for the quality of sequence-based function assignment using large-scale data in a systematic way. Results: We present an analysis of the relationship between sequence similarity and function similarity for the proteins in four model organisms, i.e., Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorrhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Using a measure of functional similarity based on the three categories of Gene Ontology (GO) classifications (biological process, molecular function, and cellular component), we quantified the correlation between functional similarity and sequence similarity measured by sequence identity or statistical significance of the alignment and compared such a correlation against randomly chosen protein pairs. Conclusion: Various sequence-function relationships were identified from BLAST versus PSI-BLAST, sequence identity versus Expectation Value, GO indices versus semantic similarity approaches, and within genome versus between genome comparisons, for the three GO categories. Our study provides a benchmark to estimate the confidence in assignment of functions purely based on sequence similarity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Joshi and Xu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In particular, existing deep learning methods consider mostly either class balanced data or moderately imbalanced data in model training, and ignore the challenge of learning from significantly imbalanced training data. To address this problem, we formulate a class imbalanced deep learning model based on batch-wise incremental minority (sparsely sampled) class rectification by hard sample mining in majority (frequently sampled) classes during model training. This model is designed to minimise the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely sampled boundaries of minority classes in an iterative batch-wise learning process. To that end, we introduce a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) function that can be deployed readily in deep network architectures. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on three imbalanced person attribute benchmark datasets (CelebA, X-Domain, DeepFashion) and one balanced object category benchmark dataset (CIFAR-100). These experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages and model scalability of the proposed batch-wise incremental minority class rectification model over the existing state-of-the-art models for addressing the problem of imbalanced data learning.},

abstract = {Motivation: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications. Results: We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.},

abstract = {Predicting phosphorylation protein is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins have multi-label features meaning that they may be phosphorylated at two or more different type amino acids. In fact, human protein usually be phosphorylated at serine, threonine and tyrosine. By introducing the "multi-label learning" approach, a novel predictor has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multi-label phosphorylation protein. Here we proposed a predictor called Multi-iPPseEvo by (1) incorporating the protein sequence evolutionary information into the general pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) via the grey system theory, (2) balancing out the skewed training datasets by the asymmetric bootstrap approach, and (3) constructing an ensemble predictor by fusing an array of individual random forest classifiers thru a voting system. Rigorous cross-validations via a set of multi-label metrics indicate that the multi-label phosphorylation predictor is very promising and encouraging. The current approach represents a new strategy to deal with the multi-label biological problems, and the software is freely available for academic use at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/Multi-iPPseEvo.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multi-label approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions because multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to their non-convexity and discontinuity. These approaches are effective empirically, however, little effort has been devoted to the understanding of their consistency, i.e., the convergence of the risk of learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on this important issue. We first prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Then, we study the consistency of two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss. For ranking loss, our results disclose that, surprisingly, none of convex surrogate loss is consistent; we present the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate losses are proven to be consistent. We also discuss on the consistency of univariate surrogate losses. For hamming loss, we show that two multi-label learning methods, i.e., one-vs-all and pairwise comparison, which can be regarded as direct extensions from multi-class learning, are inconsistent in general cases yet consistent under the dominating setting, and similar results also hold for some recent multi-label approaches that are variations of one-vs-all. In addition, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches that address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.},

Almost all of the traditional machine leaning methods require fixed length features to represent the protein sequences. However, it is never an easy task to extract the discriminative features with limited knowledge of proteins. On the other hand, deep learning technique has demonstrated its advantage in automatically learning representations. It is worthwhile to explore the applications of deep learning techniques to the protein remote homology detection. Results: In this study, we employ the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) to learn effective features from pseudo proteins, also propose a predictor called ProDec-BLSTM: it includes input layer, bidirectional LSTM, time distributed dense layer and output layer. This neural network can automatically extract the discriminative features by using bidirectional LSTM and the time distributed dense layer. Conclusion: Experimental results on a widely-used benchmark dataset show that ProDec-BLSTM outperforms other related methods in terms of both the mean ROC and mean ROC50 scores. This promising result shows that ProDec-BLSTM is a useful tool for protein remote homology detection. Furthermore, the hidden patterns learnt by ProDec-BLSTM can be interpreted and visualized, and therefore, additional useful information can be obtained.},

abstract = {Nearest-neighbor (NN) rules provide a simple and powerful quantitative framework for RNA structure prediction that is strongly supported for canonical Watson-Crick duplexes from a plethora of thermodynamic measurements. Predictions of RNA secondary structure based on nearest-neighbor (NN) rules are routinely used to understand biological function and to engineer and control new functions in biotechnology. However, NN applications to RNA structural features such as internal and terminal loops rely on approximations and assumptions, with sparse experimental coverage of the vast number of possible sequence and structural features. To test to what extent NN rules accurately predict thermodynamic stabilities across RNAs with non-WC features, we tested their predictions using a quantitative high-throughput assay platform, RNA-MaP. Using a thermodynamic assay with coupled protein binding, we carried out equilibrium measurements for over 1000 RNAs with a range of predicted secondary structure stabilities. Our results revealed substantial scatter and systematic deviations between NN predictions and observed stabilities. Solution salt effects and incorrect or omitted loop parameters contribute to these observed deviations. Our results demonstrate the need to independently and quantitatively test NN computational algorithms to identify their capabilities and limitations. RNA-MaP and related approaches can be used to test computational predictions and can be adapted to obtain experimental data to improve RNA secondary structure and other prediction algorithms.

Significance statement RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are routinely used to understand, predict and design functional RNA structures in biology and biotechnology. Given the vast number of RNA sequence and structural features, these predictions rely on a series of approximations, and independent tests are needed to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of predicted RNA structural stabilities. Here we measure the stabilities of over 1000 RNA constructs by using a coupled protein binding assay. Our results reveal substantial deviations from the RNA stabilities predicted by popular algorithms, and identify factors contributing to the observed deviations. We demonstrate the importance of quantitative, experimental tests of computational RNA structure predictions and present an approach that can be used to routinely test and improve the prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {As many structures of protein-DNA complexes have been known in the past years, several computational methods have been developed to predict DNA-binding sites in proteins. However, its inverse problem (i.e., predicting protein-binding sites in DNA) has received much less attention. One of the reasons is that the differences between the interaction propensities of nucleotides are much smaller than those between amino acids. Another reason is that DNA exhibits less diverse sequence patterns than protein. Therefore, predicting protein-binding DNA nucleotides is much harder than predicting DNA-binding amino acids. We computed the interaction propensity (IP) of nucleotide triplets with amino acids using an extensive dataset of protein-DNA complexes, and developed two support vector machine (SVM) models that predict protein-binding nucleotides from sequence data alone. One SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using DNA sequence data alone, and the other SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using both DNA and protein sequences. In a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences, the SVM model that uses DNA sequence data only predicted protein-binding nucleotides with an accuracy of 67.0{\%}, an F-measure of 67.1{\%}, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.340. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs that were not used in training, it achieved an accuracy of 66.2{\%}, an F-measure 66.3{\%} and a MCC of 0.324. Another SVM model that uses both DNA and protein sequences achieved an accuracy of 69.6{\%}, an F-measure of 69.6{\%}, and a MCC of 0.383 in a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences and 859 protein sequences. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs and 143 proteins, it showed an accuracy of 67.3{\%}, an F-measure of 66.5{\%} and a MCC of 0.329. Both in cross-validation and independent testing, the second SVM model that used both DNA and protein sequence data showed better performance than the first model that used DNA sequence data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict protein-binding nucleotides in a given DNA sequence from the sequence data alone.},

abstract = {Motivation: The computational identification of non-coding RNA regions on the genome is currently receiving much attention. However, it is essentially harder than gene-finding problems for protein-coding regions because non-coding RNA sequences do not have strong statistical signals. Since comparative sequence analysis is effective for non-coding RNA detection, efficient computational methods are expected for structural alignment of RNA sequences. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish the structural alignment tasks for RNA sequences, and we found that one of the most important points is to estimate an accurate score matrix for calculating structural alignments. Results: We propose a novel approach for RNA structural alignment based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach has some specific features compared with previous methods in the sense that the parameters for structural alignment are estimated such that the model can most probably discriminate between correct alignments and incorrect alignments, and has the generalization ability so that a satisfiable score matrix can be obtained even with a small number of sample data without overfitting. Experimental results clearly show that the parameter estimation with CRFs can outperform all the other existing methods for structural alignments of RNA sequences. Furthermore, structural alignment search based on CRFs is more accurate for predicting non-coding RNA regions than the other scoring methods. These experimental results strongly support our discriminative method employing CRFs to estimate the score matrix parameters. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Background: RNA structure prediction is an important field in bioinformatics, and numerous methods and tools have been proposed. Pseudoknots are specific motifs of RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure. Results: We propose here an original method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of RNA secondary structure prediction, namely MEA and MFE. The resulting tool, called BiokoP, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F1-score) is, in most cases, given by BiokoP. Moreover, the results of BiokoP are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F1-scores are always higher than 70{\%} for any number of solutions returned. Conclusion: The results obtained by BiokoP show that combining the MEA and the MFE models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the MEA and the MFE models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models. BiokoP is available on the EvryRNA platform: https://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.},

The identification of m6A sites in RNAs is significantly important for both basic biomedical research and practical drug development. In this study, we designed a computational-based method, called TargetM6A, to rapidly and accurately target m6A sites solely from the primary RNA sequences. Two new features, i.e., position-specific nucleotide/dinucleotide propensities (PSNP/PSDP), are introduced and combined with the traditional nucleotide composition (NC) feature to formulate RNA sequences. The extracted features are further optimized to obtain a much more compact and discriminative feature subset by applying an incremental feature selection (IFS) procedure. Based on the optimized feature subset, we trained TargetM6A on the training dataset with a support vector machine (SVM) as the prediction engine. We compared the proposed TargetM6A method with existing methods for predicting m6A sites by performing stringent jackknife tests and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Target M6A method outperformed the existing methods for predicting m6A sites and remarkably improved the prediction performances, with MCC = 0.526 and AUC = 0.818.

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many fundamental biological processes essential for cellular function. Most of the existing computational approaches employed only the sequence context of the target residue for its prediction. In the present study, for each target residue, we applied both the spatial context and the sequence context to construct the feature space. Subsequently, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was applied to remove the redundancies in the feature space. Finally, a predictor (PDNAsite) was developed through the integration of the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and ensemble learning. Results on the PDNA-62 and the PDNA-224 datasets demonstrate that features extracted from spatial context provide more information than those from sequence context and the combination of them gives more performance gain. An analysis of the number of binding sites in the spatial context of the target site indicates that the interactions between binding sites next to each other are important for protein-DNA recognition and their binding ability. The comparison between our proposed PDNAsite method and the existing methods indicate that PDNAsite outperforms most of the existing methods and is a useful tool for DNA-binding site identification.

Robust methods are required to detect the numerous binding sites of RBPs across the transcriptome. RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) and crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) are state-of-the-art methods used to identify the RNA targets and specific binding sites of RBPs. Historically, CLIP methods have been confounded with challenges such as the requirement for tens of millions of cells per experiment, low RNA yields resulting in libraries that contain a high number of polymerase chain reaction duplicated reads, and technical inconveniences such as radioactive labeling of RNAs. However, recent improvements in the recovery of bound RNAs and the efficiency of converting isolated RNAs into a library for sequencing have enhanced our ability to perform the experiment at scale, from less starting material than has previously been possible, and resulting in high quality datasets for the confident identification of protein binding sites. These, along with additional improvements to protein capture, removal of nonspecific signals, and methods to isolate noncanonical RBP targets have revolutionized the study of RNA processing regulation, and reveal a promising future for mapping the human protein-RNA regulatory network.

abstract = {Motivation: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications. Results: We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.},

abstract = {Background: RNA structure prediction is an important field in bioinformatics, and numerous methods and tools have been proposed. Pseudoknots are specific motifs of RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure. Results: We propose here an original method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of RNA secondary structure prediction, namely MEA and MFE. The resulting tool, called BiokoP, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F1-score) is, in most cases, given by BiokoP. Moreover, the results of BiokoP are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F1-scores are always higher than 70{\%} for any number of solutions returned. Conclusion: The results obtained by BiokoP show that combining the MEA and the MFE models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the MEA and the MFE models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models. BiokoP is available on the EvryRNA platform: https://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.},

Once the sample dataset is not balanced , the classification performance drops sharply. To efficiently deal with the imbalance of data, an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm is proposed in this work. Firstly, we construct artificial samples so that more minority-class's data can be obtained via optimizing GAN loss function. Secondly, we build a fully-connected network for structured data classification. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted on two open structured-datasets and the results of the proposed algorithm demonstrate a good applicability for the classification of structured data.},

abstract = {Motivation: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications. Results: We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.},

This task is known as hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC), with applications in text classification, image annotation, and in bioinformatics problems such as protein function prediction. In this paper, we propose novel neural network architectures for HMC called HMCN, capable of simultaneously optimizing local and global loss functions for discovering local hierarchical class-relationships and global information from the entire class hierarchy while penalizing hierarchical violations. We evaluate its performance in 21 datasets from four distinct domains, and we compare it against the current HMC state-of-the-art approaches.

abstract = {As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.},

abstract = {Protein fold recognition is an important step towards understanding protein three-dimensional structures and their functions. A conditional graphical model, i.e., segmentation conditional random fields (SCRFs), is proposed as an effective solution to this problem. In contrast to traditional graphical models, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM), SCRFs follow a discriminative approach. Therefore, it is flexible to include any features in the model, such as overlapping or long-range interaction features over the whole sequence. The model also employs a convex optimization function, which results in globally optimal solutions to the model parameters. On the other hand, the segmentation setting in SCRFs makes their graphical structures intuitively similar to the protein 3-D structures and more importantly provides a framework to model the long-range interactions between secondary structures directly. Our model is applied to predict the parallel $\beta$-helix fold, an important fold in bacterial pathogenesis and carbohydrate binding/cleavage. The cross-family validation shows that SCRFs not only can score all known $\beta$-helices higher than non-$\beta$-helices in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but also accurately locates rungs in known beta-helix proteins. Our method outperforms BetaWrap, a state-of-the-art algorithm for predicting beta-helix folds, and HMMER, a general motif detection algorithm based on HMM, and has the additional advantage of general application to other protein folds. Applying our prediction model to the Uniprot Database, we identify previously unknown potential $\beta$-helices. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore{\textgreater}0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {Nearest-neighbor (NN) rules provide a simple and powerful quantitative framework for RNA structure prediction that is strongly supported for canonical Watson-Crick duplexes from a plethora of thermodynamic measurements. Predictions of RNA secondary structure based on nearest-neighbor (NN) rules are routinely used to understand biological function and to engineer and control new functions in biotechnology. However, NN applications to RNA structural features such as internal and terminal loops rely on approximations and assumptions, with sparse experimental coverage of the vast number of possible sequence and structural features. To test to what extent NN rules accurately predict thermodynamic stabilities across RNAs with non-WC features, we tested their predictions using a quantitative high-throughput assay platform, RNA-MaP. Using a thermodynamic assay with coupled protein binding, we carried out equilibrium measurements for over 1000 RNAs with a range of predicted secondary structure stabilities. Our results revealed substantial scatter and systematic deviations between NN predictions and observed stabilities. Solution salt effects and incorrect or omitted loop parameters contribute to these observed deviations. Our results demonstrate the need to independently and quantitatively test NN computational algorithms to identify their capabilities and limitations. RNA-MaP and related approaches can be used to test computational predictions and can be adapted to obtain experimental data to improve RNA secondary structure and other prediction algorithms.

Significance statement RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are routinely used to understand, predict and design functional RNA structures in biology and biotechnology. Given the vast number of RNA sequence and structural features, these predictions rely on a series of approximations, and independent tests are needed to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of predicted RNA structural stabilities. Here we measure the stabilities of over 1000 RNA constructs by using a coupled protein binding assay. Our results reveal substantial deviations from the RNA stabilities predicted by popular algorithms, and identify factors contributing to the observed deviations. We demonstrate the importance of quantitative, experimental tests of computational RNA structure predictions and present an approach that can be used to routinely test and improve the prediction accuracy.},

Therefore, its significance to academic research and drug development is understandable. Through biochemical experiments, the pseudouridine site identification has produced good outcomes, but these lab exploratory methods and biochemical processes are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is important to introduce efficient methods for identification of pseudouridine sites. In this study, an intelligent method for pseudouridine sites using the deep-learning approach was developed. The proposed prediction model is called iPseU-CNN (identifying pseudouridine by convolutional neural networks). The existing methods used handcrafted features and machine-learning approaches to identify pseudouridine sites. However, the proposed predictor extracts the features of the pseudouridine sites automatically using a convolution neural network model. The iPseU-CNN model yields better outcomes than the current state-of-the-art models in all evaluation parameters. It is thus highly projected that the iPseU-CNN predictor will become a helpful tool for academic research on pseudouridine site prediction of RNA, as well as in drug discovery.},

abstract = {As many structures of protein-DNA complexes have been known in the past years, several computational methods have been developed to predict DNA-binding sites in proteins. However, its inverse problem (i.e., predicting protein-binding sites in DNA) has received much less attention. One of the reasons is that the differences between the interaction propensities of nucleotides are much smaller than those between amino acids. Another reason is that DNA exhibits less diverse sequence patterns than protein. Therefore, predicting protein-binding DNA nucleotides is much harder than predicting DNA-binding amino acids. We computed the interaction propensity (IP) of nucleotide triplets with amino acids using an extensive dataset of protein-DNA complexes, and developed two support vector machine (SVM) models that predict protein-binding nucleotides from sequence data alone. One SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using DNA sequence data alone, and the other SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using both DNA and protein sequences. In a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences, the SVM model that uses DNA sequence data only predicted protein-binding nucleotides with an accuracy of 67.0{\%}, an F-measure of 67.1{\%}, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.340. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs that were not used in training, it achieved an accuracy of 66.2{\%}, an F-measure 66.3{\%} and a MCC of 0.324. Another SVM model that uses both DNA and protein sequences achieved an accuracy of 69.6{\%}, an F-measure of 69.6{\%}, and a MCC of 0.383 in a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences and 859 protein sequences. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs and 143 proteins, it showed an accuracy of 67.3{\%}, an F-measure of 66.5{\%} and a MCC of 0.329. Both in cross-validation and independent testing, the second SVM model that used both DNA and protein sequence data showed better performance than the first model that used DNA sequence data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict protein-binding nucleotides in a given DNA sequence from the sequence data alone.},

The identification of m6A sites in RNAs is significantly important for both basic biomedical research and practical drug development. In this study, we designed a computational-based method, called TargetM6A, to rapidly and accurately target m6A sites solely from the primary RNA sequences. Two new features, i.e., position-specific nucleotide/dinucleotide propensities (PSNP/PSDP), are introduced and combined with the traditional nucleotide composition (NC) feature to formulate RNA sequences. The extracted features are further optimized to obtain a much more compact and discriminative feature subset by applying an incremental feature selection (IFS) procedure. Based on the optimized feature subset, we trained TargetM6A on the training dataset with a support vector machine (SVM) as the prediction engine. We compared the proposed TargetM6A method with existing methods for predicting m6A sites by performing stringent jackknife tests and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Target M6A method outperformed the existing methods for predicting m6A sites and remarkably improved the prediction performances, with MCC = 0.526 and AUC = 0.818.

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) enable innovative applications of machine learning like image recognition, machine translation, or malware detection. However, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of robustness in adversarial settings (e.g., vulnerability to adversarial inputs) and general inability to rationalize its predictions. In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.},

abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

abstract = {Motivation: Computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction play important roles in protein function studies and experimental design. Most existing methods are based on feature extraction, which may result in incomplete or biased features. Deep learning as the cutting-edge machine learning method has the ability to automatically discover complex representations of phosphorylation patterns from the raw sequences, and hence it provides a powerful tool for improvement of phosphorylation site prediction. Results: We present MusiteDeep, the first deep-learning framework for predicting general and kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. MusiteDeep takes raw sequence data as input and uses convolutional neural networks with a novel two-dimensional attention mechanism. It achieves over a 50{\%} relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve in general phosphorylation site prediction and obtains competitive results in kinase-specific prediction compared to other well-known tools on the benchmark data.

abstract = {Predicting phosphorylation protein is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins have multi-label features meaning that they may be phosphorylated at two or more different type amino acids. In fact, human protein usually be phosphorylated at serine, threonine and tyrosine. By introducing the "multi-label learning" approach, a novel predictor has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multi-label phosphorylation protein. Here we proposed a predictor called Multi-iPPseEvo by (1) incorporating the protein sequence evolutionary information into the general pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) via the grey system theory, (2) balancing out the skewed training datasets by the asymmetric bootstrap approach, and (3) constructing an ensemble predictor by fusing an array of individual random forest classifiers thru a voting system. Rigorous cross-validations via a set of multi-label metrics indicate that the multi-label phosphorylation predictor is very promising and encouraging. The current approach represents a new strategy to deal with the multi-label biological problems, and the software is freely available for academic use at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/Multi-iPPseEvo.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have achieved excellent recognition performance in various visual recognition tasks. A large labeled training set is one of the most important factors for its success. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient training images with precise labels in some domains such as apparent age estimation, head pose estimation, multi-label classification and semantic segmentation. Fortunately, there is ambiguous information among labels, which makes these tasks different from traditional classification. Based on this observation, we convert the label of each image into a discrete label distribution, and learn the label distribution by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and ground-truth label distributions using deep ConvNets. The proposed DLDL (Deep Label Distribution Learning) method effectively utilizes the label ambiguity in both feature learning and classifier learning, which help prevent the network from over-fitting even when the training set is small. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods for age estimation and head pose estimation. At the same time, it also improves recognition performance for multi-label classification and semantic segmentation tasks.},

abstract = {Identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) is important in the computational inference of gene regulation. Widely used computational methods of TFBS prediction based on position weight matrices (PWMs) usually have high false positive rates. Moreover, computational studies of transcription regulation in eukaryotes frequently require numerous PWM models of TFBSs due to a large number of TFs involved. To overcome these problems we developed DRAF, a novel method for TFBS prediction that requires only 14 prediction models for 232 human TFs, while at the same time significantly improves prediction accuracy. DRAF models use more features than PWM models, as they combine information from TFBS sequences and physicochemical properties of TF DNA-binding domains into machine learning models. Evaluation of DRAF on 98 human ChIP-seq datasets shows on average 1.54-, 1.96- and 5.19-fold reduction of false positives at the same sensitivities compared to models from HOCOMOCO, TRANSFAC and DeepBind, respectively. This observation suggests that one can efficiently replace the PWM models for TFBS prediction by a small number of DRAF models that significantly improve prediction accuracy. The DRAF method is implemented in a web tool and in a stand-alone software freely available at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/DRAF.},

Results: We proposed a CapsNet for predicting protein PTM sites, including phosphorylation, N-linked glycosylation, N6-acetyllysine, methyl-arginine, S-palmitoyl-cysteine, pyrrolidone-carboxylic-acid and SUMOylation sites. The CapsNet outperformed the baseline convolutional neural network architecture MusiteDeep and other well-known tools in most cases and provided promising results for practical use, especially in learning from small training data. The capsule length also gives an accurate estimate for the confidence of the PTM prediction. We further demonstrated that the internal capsule features could be trained as a motif detector of phosphorylation sites when no kinase-specific phosphorylation labels were provided. In addition, CapsNet generates robust representations that have strong discriminant power in distinguishing kinase substrates from different kinase families. Our study sheds some light on the recognition mechanism of PTMs and applications of CapsNet on other bioinformatic problems.},

Identifying variants that disrupt TF binding and lead to human diseases remains a great challenge. To address this, we implement sequence-based deep learning models that accurately predict the TF binding intensities to given DNA sequences. In addition to accurately classifying TF-DNA binding or unbinding, our models are capable of accurately predicting real-valued TF binding intensities by leveraging large-scale TF ChIP-seq data. The changes in the TF binding intensities between the altered sequence and the reference sequence reflect the degree of functional impact for the variant. This enables us to develop the tool DeFine (Deep learning based Functional impact of non-coding variants evaluator, http://define.cbi.pku.edu.cn) with improved performance for assessing the functional impact of non-coding variants including SNPs and indels.

Robust methods are required to detect the numerous binding sites of RBPs across the transcriptome. RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) and crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) are state-of-the-art methods used to identify the RNA targets and specific binding sites of RBPs. Historically, CLIP methods have been confounded with challenges such as the requirement for tens of millions of cells per experiment, low RNA yields resulting in libraries that contain a high number of polymerase chain reaction duplicated reads, and technical inconveniences such as radioactive labeling of RNAs. However, recent improvements in the recovery of bound RNAs and the efficiency of converting isolated RNAs into a library for sequencing have enhanced our ability to perform the experiment at scale, from less starting material than has previously been possible, and resulting in high quality datasets for the confident identification of protein binding sites. These, along with additional improvements to protein capture, removal of nonspecific signals, and methods to isolate noncanonical RBP targets have revolutionized the study of RNA processing regulation, and reveal a promising future for mapping the human protein-RNA regulatory network.

This approach borrows principles from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to exploit the power of classifiers for measuring two-sample divergence. We provide theoretical results for conditions in which the estimation error is bounded by two factors: (i) the discrepancy measure induced by the discriminator; and (ii) the weights variability.

It is worthwhile to explore the applications of deep learning techniques to the protein remote homology detection.

abstract = {Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},

abstract = {Background: RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and secondary structure specificities is challenging for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs detection. Results: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. Conclusion: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.},

abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

abstract = {Model learning from class imbalanced training data is a long-standing and significant challenge for machine learning. In particular, existing deep learning methods consider mostly either class balanced data or moderately imbalanced data in model training, and ignore the challenge of learning from significantly imbalanced training data. To address this problem, we formulate a class imbalanced deep learning model based on batch-wise incremental minority (sparsely sampled) class rectification by hard sample mining in majority (frequently sampled) classes during model training. This model is designed to minimise the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely sampled boundaries of minority classes in an iterative batch-wise learning process. To that end, we introduce a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) function that can be deployed readily in deep network architectures. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on three imbalanced person attribute benchmark datasets (CelebA, X-Domain, DeepFashion) and one balanced object category benchmark dataset (CIFAR-100). These experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages and model scalability of the proposed batch-wise incremental minority class rectification model over the existing state-of-the-art models for addressing the problem of imbalanced data learning.},

abstract = {Motivation Determining RNA binding protein(RBP) binding specificity is crucial for understanding many cellular processes and genetic disorders. RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance.

Results We propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input.

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure determination has primarily been performed using X-ray crystallography. To overcome the expensive cost, high attrition rate and series of trial-and-error settings, many in-silico methods have been developed to predict crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. However, the majority of these methods build their predictors by extracting features from protein sequences, which is computationally expensive and can explode the feature space. We propose DeepCrystal, a deep learning framework for sequence-based protein crystallization prediction. It uses deep learning to identify proteins which can produce diffraction quality crystals without the need to manually engineer additional biochemical and structural features from sequence. Our model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can exploit frequently occurring k-mers and sets of k-mers from the protein sequences to distinguish proteins that will result in diffraction quality crystals from those that will not. Results: Our model surpasses previous sequence-based protein crystallization predictors in terms of recall, F-score, accuracy and MCC on three independent test sets. DeepCrystal achieves an average improvement of 1.4{\%}, 12.1{\%} in recall, when compared to its closest competitors, Crysalis II and Crysf respectively.

Similar to proteins, RNA structures may be altered due to the interaction with various ligands, including proteins, other RNAs, and metabolites. A riboswitch is a molecular mechanism, found in the three kingdoms of life, in which the RNA structure is modified by the binding of a metabolite.

Most of the existing computational approaches employed only the sequence context of the target residue for its prediction. In the present study, for each target residue, we applied both the spatial context and the sequence context to construct the feature space. Subsequently, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was applied to remove the redundancies in the feature space. Finally, a predictor (PDNAsite) was developed through the integration of the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and ensemble learning. Results on the PDNA-62 and the PDNA-224 datasets demonstrate that features extracted from spatial context provide more information than those from sequence context and the combination of them gives more performance gain. An analysis of the number of binding sites in the spatial context of the target site indicates that the interactions between binding sites next to each other are important for protein-DNA recognition and their binding ability.

Given such examples, we illustrate how architectures consisting of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks can relatively easily be designed and trained to state-of-the-art performance on three biological sequence problems: prediction of subcellular localization, protein secondary structure and the binding of peptides to MHC Class II molecules.},

abstract = {Identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) is important in the computational inference of gene regulation. Widely used computational methods of TFBS prediction based on position weight matrices (PWMs) usually have high false positive rates. Moreover, computational studies of transcription regulation in eukaryotes frequently require numerous PWM models of TFBSs due to a large number of TFs involved. To overcome these problems we developed DRAF, a novel method for TFBS prediction that requires only 14 prediction models for 232 human TFs, while at the same time significantly improves prediction accuracy. DRAF models use more features than PWM models, as they combine information from TFBS sequences and physicochemical properties of TF DNA-binding domains into machine learning models. Evaluation of DRAF on 98 human ChIP-seq datasets shows on average 1.54-, 1.96- and 5.19-fold reduction of false positives at the same sensitivities compared to models from HOCOMOCO, TRANSFAC and DeepBind, respectively. This observation suggests that one can efficiently replace the PWM models for TFBS prediction by a small number of DRAF models that significantly improve prediction accuracy. The DRAF method is implemented in a web tool and in a stand-alone software freely available at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/DRAF.},

abstract = {As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.},

Deep learning offers a new opportunity to significantly improve prediction accuracy. In this article, a new deep neural network architecture, named the Deep inception-inside-inception (Deep3I) network, is proposed for protein secondary structure prediction and implemented as a software tool MUFOLD-SS. The input to MUFOLD-SS is a carefully designed feature matrix corresponding to the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which consists of a rich set of information derived from individual amino acid, as well as the context of the protein sequence. Specifically, the feature matrix is a composition of physio-chemical properties of amino acids, PSI-BLAST profile, and HHBlits profile. MUFOLD-SS is composed of a sequence of nested inception modules and maps the input matrix to either eight states or three states of secondary structures. The architecture of MUFOLD-SS enables effective processing of local and global interactions between amino acids in making accurate prediction. In extensive experiments on multiple datasets, MUFOLD-SS outperformed the best existing methods and other deep neural networks significantly.

Despite major efforts to develop accurate enhancer prediction methods, identifying enhancer sequences continues to be a challenge in the annotation of mammalian genomes. One of the major issues is the lack of large, sufficiently comprehensive and experimentally validated enhancers for humans or other species. Thus, the development of computational methods based on limited experimentally validated enhancers and deciphering the transcriptional regulatory code encoded in the enhancer sequences is urgent. Results We present a deep-learning-based hybrid architecture, BiRen, which predicts enhancers using the DNA sequence alone. Our results demonstrate that BiRen can learn common enhancer patterns directly from the DNA sequence and exhibits superior accuracy, robustness and generalizability in enhancer prediction relative to other state-of-the-art enhancer predictors based on sequence characteristics.

abstract = {Motivation: Inferring properties of biological sequences--such as determining the species-of-origin of a DNA sequence or the function of an amino-acid sequence--is a core task in many bioinformatics applications. These tasks are often solved using string-matching to map query sequences to labeled database sequences or via Hidden Markov Model-like pattern matching. In the current work we describe and assess an deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences. Results: We demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult, practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13,000 distinct species, our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0{\%} of perfect memorization of training data, and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer, alignment, and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover, our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally, we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall, our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.

The capsule length also gives an accurate estimate for the confidence of the PTM prediction. We further demonstrated that the internal capsule features could be trained as a motif detector of phosphorylation sites when no kinase-specific phosphorylation labels were provided. In addition, CapsNet generates robust representations that have strong discriminant power in distinguishing kinase substrates from different kinase families.

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure determination has primarily been performed using X-ray crystallography. To overcome the expensive cost, high attrition rate and series of trial-and-error settings, many in-silico methods have been developed to predict crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. However, the majority of these methods build their predictors by extracting features from protein sequences, which is computationally expensive and can explode the feature space. We propose DeepCrystal, a deep learning framework for sequence-based protein crystallization prediction. It uses deep learning to identify proteins which can produce diffraction quality crystals without the need to manually engineer additional biochemical and structural features from sequence. Our model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can exploit frequently occurring k-mers and sets of k-mers from the protein sequences to distinguish proteins that will result in diffraction quality crystals from those that will not. Results: Our model surpasses previous sequence-based protein crystallization predictors in terms of recall, F-score, accuracy and MCC on three independent test sets. DeepCrystal achieves an average improvement of 1.4{\%}, 12.1{\%} in recall, when compared to its closest competitors, Crysalis II and Crysf respectively.

abstract = {This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational data, which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.},

The generalized linear model path algorithm efficiently computes solutions along the entire regularization path by using the pre- dictor–corrector method of convex optimization. Selecting the step length of the regularization parameter is critical in controlling the overall accuracy of the paths; we suggest intuitive and flexible strategies for choosing appropriate values.

In this work, we study how deep convolutional neural network methods (ConvNets) may be best designed and developed to solve this long-standing problem. With publicly available datasets, we designed and trained various ConvNet architectures. We tested several recent deep learning techniques including wide residual networks, dropouts, and dilated convolutions. We studied the improvements in the precision of medium-range and long-range contacts, and compared the performance of our best architectures with the ones used in existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed ConvNet architectures predict contacts with significantly more precision than the architectures used in several state-of-the-art methods. When trained using the DeepCov dataset consisting of 3,456 proteins and tested on PSICOV dataset of 150 proteins, our architectures achieve up to 15{\%} higher precision when L/2 long-range contacts are evaluated. Similarly, when trained using the DNCON2 dataset consisting of 1,426 proteins and tested on 84 protein domains in the CASP12 dataset, our single network achieves 4.8{\%} higher precision than the ensembled DNCON2 method when top L long-range contacts are evaluated.

abstract = {Motivation: Various bacterial pathogens can deliver their secreted substrates also called effectors through Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) into host cells and cause diseases. Since T3SS secreted effectors (T3SEs) play important roles in pathogen'host interactions, identifying them is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of T3SSs. However, the effectors display high level of sequence diversity, therefore making the identification a difficult process. There is a need to develop a novel and effective method to screen and select putative novel effectors from bacterial genomes that can be validated by a smaller number of key experiments. Results: We develop a deep convolution neural network to directly classify any protein sequence into T3SEs or non-T3SEs, which is useful for both effector prediction and the study of sequence-function relationship. Different from traditional machine learning-based methods, our method automatically extracts T3SE-related features from a protein N-Terminal sequence of 100 residues and maps it to the T3SEs space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from 16 species, yielding an average classification accuracy of 83.7{\%} in the 5-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 92.6{\%} for the test set. Moreover, when comparing with known state-of-The-Art prediction methods, the accuracy of our method is 6.31-20.73{\%} higher than previous methods on a common independent dataset. Besides, we visualize the convolutional kernels and successfully identify the key features of T3SEs, which contain important signal information for secretion. Finally, some effectors reported in the literature are used to further demonstrate the application of DeepT3.},

abstract = {Graph embedding learning which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node representations has drawn increasing attention in recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding methods are mainly evaluated on social and information networks and have not been comprehensively studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization have shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding methods (e.g., random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art. We select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic comparison on three important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and two node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods which have not been explored completely on biomedical tasks achieve promising results and deserve more attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Besides, compared with three state-of-the-art methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any biological features. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks. We also develop an easy-to-use Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.},

@article{Fa2018,
abstract = {Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},

In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above.

Sequences do not have explicit features, and the commonly used representations introduce the main drawback of the high dimensionality. For sure, machine learning method devoted to supervised classification tasks are strongly dependent on the feature extraction step, and in order to build a good representation it is necessary to recognize and measure meaningful details of the items to classify. Recently, neural deep learning architectures or deep learning models, were proved to be able to extract automatically useful features from input patterns.

abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore{\textgreater}0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

abstract = {Motivation Determining RNA binding protein(RBP) binding specificity is crucial for understanding many cellular processes and genetic disorders. RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance.

Results We propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have achieved excellent recognition performance in various visual recognition tasks. A large labeled training set is one of the most important factors for its success. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient training images with precise labels in some domains such as apparent age estimation, head pose estimation, multi-label classification and semantic segmentation. Fortunately, there is ambiguous information among labels, which makes these tasks different from traditional classification. Based on this observation, we convert the label of each image into a discrete label distribution, and learn the label distribution by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and ground-truth label distributions using deep ConvNets. The proposed DLDL (Deep Label Distribution Learning) method effectively utilizes the label ambiguity in both feature learning and classifier learning, which help prevent the network from over-fitting even when the training set is small. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods for age estimation and head pose estimation. At the same time, it also improves recognition performance for multi-label classification and semantic segmentation tasks.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

To predict the noncoding-variant effects de novo from sequence, we developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework, DeepSEA (http://deepsea.princeton.edu/), that directly learns a regulatory sequence code from large-scale chromatin-profiling data, enabling prediction of chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single-nucleotide sensitivity. We further used this capability to improve prioritization of functional variants including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and disease-associated variants.},

abstract = {Motivation: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) take over 5-10{\%} of the eukaryotic proteome and play key roles in many biological processes, e.g. gene regulation. Experimental detection of RBP binding sites is still time-intensive and high-costly. Instead, computational prediction of the RBP binding sites using patterns learned from existing annotation knowledge is a fast approach. From the biological point of view, the local structure context derived from local sequences will be recognized by specific RBPs. However, in computational modeling using deep learning, to our best knowledge, only global representations of entire RNA sequences are employed. So far, the local sequence information is ignored in the deep model construction process. Results: In this study, we present a computational method iDeepE to predict RNA-protein binding sites from RNA sequences by combining global and local convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For the global CNN, we pad the RNA sequences into the same length. For the local CNN, we split a RNA sequence into multiple overlapping fixed-length subsequences, where each subsequence is a signal channel of the whole sequence. Next, we train deep CNNs for multiple subsequences and the padded sequences to learn high-level features, respectively. Finally, the outputs from local and global CNNs are combined to improve the prediction. iDeepE demonstrates a better performance over state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets derived from CLIP-seq. We also find that the local CNN runs 1.8 times faster than the global CNN with comparable performance when using GPUs. Our results show that iDeepE has captured experimentally verified binding motifs. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepE.

abstract = {Background: RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and secondary structure specificities is challenging for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs detection. Results: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. Conclusion: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.},

abstract = {The recently proposed Temporal Ensembling has achieved state-of-the-art results in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. It maintains an exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However, because the targets change only once per epoch, Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose Mean Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35{\%} on SVHN with 250 labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance. Combining Mean Teacher and Residual Networks, we improve the state of the art on CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels from 10.55{\%} to 6.28{\%}, and on ImageNet 2012 with 10{\%} of the labels from 35.24{\%} to 9.11{\%}.},

@article{Wang2018d,
abstract = {The complex system of gene expression is regulated by the cell type-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory elements. Identifying variants that disrupt TF binding and lead to human diseases remains a great challenge. To address this, we implement sequence-based deep learning models that accurately predict the TF binding intensities to given DNA sequences. In addition to accurately classifying TF-DNA binding or unbinding, our models are capable of accurately predicting real-valued TF binding intensities by leveraging large-scale TF ChIP-seq data. The changes in the TF binding intensities between the altered sequence and the reference sequence reflect the degree of functional impact for the variant. This enables us to develop the tool DeFine (Deep learning based Functional impact of non-coding variants evaluator, http://define.cbi.pku.edu.cn) with improved performance for assessing the functional impact of non-coding variants including SNPs and indels. DeFine accurately identifies the causal functional non-coding variants from disease-associated variants in GWAS. DeFine is an effective and easy-to-use tool that facilities systematic prioritization of functional non-coding variants.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) enable innovative applications of machine learning like image recognition, machine translation, or malware detection. However, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of robustness in adversarial settings (e.g., vulnerability to adversarial inputs) and general inability to rationalize its predictions. In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.},

abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from many issues. We developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and demonstrated that PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to iteratively learn from 22 training cell types/tissues. Our results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} geometric mean (GM) of sensitivity and specificity across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues.
