abstract = {MOTIVATION: fast{\_}protein{\_}cluster is a fast, parallel and memory efficient package used to cluster 60 000 sets of protein models (with up to 550 000 models per set) generated by the Nutritious Rice for the World project. RESULTS: fast{\_}protein{\_}cluster is an optimized and extensible toolkit that supports Root Mean Square Deviation after optimal superposition (RMSD) and Template Modeling score (TM-score) as metrics. RMSD calculations using a laptop CPU are 60x faster than qcprot and 3x faster than current graphics processing unit (GPU) implementations. New GPU code further increases the speed of RMSD and TM-score calculations. fast{\_}protein{\_}cluster provides novel k-means and hierarchical clustering methods that are up to 250x and 2000x faster, respectively, than Clusco, and identify significantly more accurate models than Spicker and Clusco. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: fast{\_}protein{\_}cluster is written in C++ using OpenMP for multi-threading support. Custom streaming Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) extensions and advanced vector extension intrinsics code accelerate CPU calculations, and OpenCL kernels support AMD and Nvidia GPUs. fast{\_}protein{\_}cluster is available under the M.I.T. license.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens heightens the need to design new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit broad-spectrum potent activity against MDR pathogens and kills rapidly, thus giving rise to AMPs being recognized as a potential substitute for conventional antibiotics. Designing new AMPs using current in-silico approaches is, however, challenging due to the absence of suitable models, large number of design parameters, testing cycles, production time and cost. To date, AMPs have merely been categorized into families according to their primary sequences, structures and functions. The ability to computationally determine the properties that discriminate AMP families from each other could help in exploring the key characteristics of these families and facilitate the in-silico design of synthetic AMPs. RESULTS: Here we studied 14 AMP families and sub-families. We selected a specific description of AMP amino acid sequence and identified compositional and physicochemical properties of amino acids that accurately distinguish each AMP family from all other AMPs with an average sensitivity, specificity and precision of 92.88{\%}, 99.86{\%} and 95.96{\%}, respectively. Many of our identified discriminative properties have been shown to be compositional or functional characteristics of the corresponding AMP family in literature. We suggest that these properties could serve as guides for in-silico methods in design of novel synthetic AMPs. The methodology we developed is generic and has a potential to be applied for characterization of any protein family.},

abstract = {We propose a novel approach for categorizing text documents based on the use of a special kernel. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space generated by all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences that are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique.},

abstract = {During the process of protein folding, the amino acid residues along the polypeptide chain interact with each other in a cooperative manner to form the stable native structure. The knowledge about inter-residue interactions in protein structures is very helpful to understand the mechanism of protein folding and stability. In this review, we introduce the classification of inter-residue interactions into short, medium and long range based on a simple geometric approach. The features of these interactions in different structural classes of globular and membrane proteins, and in various folds have been delineated. The development of contact potentials and the application of inter-residue contacts for predicting the structural class and secondary structures of globular proteins, solvent accessibility, fold recognition and ab initio tertiary structure prediction have been evaluated. Further, the relationship between inter-residue contacts and protein-folding rates has been highlighted. Moreover, the importance of inter-residue interactions in protein-folding kinetics and for understanding the stability of proteins has been discussed. In essence, the information gained from the studies on inter-residue interactions provides valuable insights for understanding protein folding and de novo protein design.},

@article{Gao2010,
abstract = {Protein folding rates vary by several orders of magnitude and they depend on the topology of the fold and the size and composition of the sequence. Although recent works show that the rates can be predicted from the sequence, allowing for high-throughput annotations, they consider only the sequence and its predicted secondary structure. We propose a novel sequence-based predictor, PFR-AF, which utilizes solvent accessibility and residue flexibility predicted from the sequence, to improve predictions and provide insights into the folding process. The predictor includes three linear regressions for proteins with two-state, multistate, and unknown (mixed-state) folding kinetics. PFR-AF on average outperforms current methods when tested on three datasets. The proposed approach provides high-quality predictions in the absence of similarity between the predicted and the training sequences. The PFR-AF's predictions are characterized by high (between 0.71 and 0.95, depending on the dataset) correlation and the lowest (between 0.75 and 0.9) mean absolute errors with respect to the experimental rates, as measured using out-of-sample tests. Our models reveal that for the two-state chains inclusion of solvent-exposed Ala may accelerate the folding, while increased content of Ile may reduce the folding speed. We also demonstrate that increased flexibility of coils facilitates faster folding and that proteins with larger content of solvent-exposed strands may fold at a slower pace. The increased flexibility of the solvent-exposed residues is shown to elongate folding, which also holds, with a lower correlation, for buried residues. Two case studies are included to support our findings.},

@article{Tamposis2019,
abstract = {Motivation: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models widely used in applications in computational sequence analysis. HMMs are basically unsupervised models. However, in the most important applications, they are trained in a supervised manner. Training examples accompanied by labels corresponding to different classes are given as input and the set of parameters that maximize the joint probability of sequences and labels is estimated. A main problem with this approach is that, in the majority of the cases, labels are hard to find and thus the amount of training data is limited. On the other hand, there are plenty of unclassified (unlabeled) sequences deposited in the public databases that could potentially contribute to the training procedure. This approach is called semi-supervised learning and could be very helpful in many applications. Results: We propose here, a method for semi-supervised learning of HMMs that can incorporate labeled, unlabeled and partially labeled data in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, where the missing labels of the unlabeled or partially labeled data are considered as the missing data. We apply the algorithm to several biological problems, namely, for the prediction of transmembrane protein topology for alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins and for the prediction of archaeal signal peptides. The results are very promising, since the algorithms presented here can significantly improve the prediction performance of even the top-scoring classifiers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of protein localization in subnuclear organelles is more challenging than general protein subcelluar localization. There are only three computational models for protein subnuclear localization thus far, to the best of our knowledge. Two models were based on protein primary sequence only. The first model assumed homogeneous amino acid substitution pattern across all protein sequence residue sites and used BLOSUM62 to encode k-mer of protein sequence. Ensemble of SVM based on different k-mers drew the final conclusion, achieving 50{\%} overall accuracy. The simplified assumption did not exploit protein sequence profile and ignored the fact of heterogeneous amino acid substitution patterns across sites. The second model derived the PsePSSM feature representation from protein sequence by simply averaging the profile PSSM and combined the PseAA feature representation to construct a kNN ensemble classifier Nuc-PLoc, achieving 67.4{\%} overall accuracy. The two models based on protein primary sequence only both achieved relatively poor predictive performance. The third model required that GO annotations be available, thus restricting the model's applicability. METHODS: In this paper, we only use the amino acid information of protein sequence without any other information to design a widely-applicable model for protein subnuclear localization. We use K-spectrum kernel to exploit the contextual information around an amino acid and the conserved motif information. Besides expanding window size, we adopt various amino acid classification approaches to capture diverse aspects of amino acid physiochemical properties. Each amino acid classification generates a series of spectrum kernels based on different window size. Thus, (I) window expansion can capture more contextual information and cover size-varying motifs; (II) various amino acid classifications can exploit multi-aspect biological information from the protein sequence. Finally, we combine all the spectrum kernels by simple addition into one single kernel called SpectrumKernel+ for protein subnuclear localization. RESULTS: We conduct the performance evaluation experiments on two benchmark datasets: Lei and Nuc-PLoc. Experimental results show that SpectrumKernel+ achieves substantial performance improvement against the previous model Nuc-PLoc, with overall accuracy 83.47{\%} against 67.4{\%}; and 71.23{\%} against 50{\%} of Lei SVM Ensemble, against 66.50{\%} of Lei GO SVM Ensemble. CONCLUSION: The method SpectrumKernel+ can exploit rich amino acid information of protein sequence by embedding into implicit size-varying motifs the multi-aspect amino acid physiochemical properties captured by amino acid classification approaches. The kernels derived from diverse amino acid classification approaches and different sizes of k-mer are summed together for data integration. Experiments show that the method SpectrumKernel+ significantly outperforms the existing models for protein subnuclear localization.},

abstract = {Progression through the cell cycle involves the coordinated activities of a suite of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. The activities of the complexes are regulated by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs). Apart from its role as cell cycle regulators, CDKIs are involved in apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, cell fate determination, cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. As the complexes perform crucial and diverse functions, these are important drug targets for tumour and stem cell therapeutic interventions. However, CDKIs are represented by proteins with considerable sequence heterogeneity and may fail to be identified by simple similarity search methods. In this work we have evaluated and developed machine learning methods for identification of CDKIs. We used different compositional features and evolutionary information in the form of PSSMs, from CDKIs and non-CDKIs for generating SVM and ANN classifiers. In the first stage, both the ANN and SVM models were evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and in the second stage these were tested on independent data sets. The PSSM-based SVM model emerged as the best classifier in both the stages and is publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/cdkipred.},

abstract = {Protein remote homology detection is one of the important tasks in computational proteomics, which is important for basic research and practical application. Currently, the SVM-based discriminative methods have shown superior performance. However, the existing feature vectors still cannot suitably represent the protein sequences, and often lack an interpretable model for analysis of characteristic features. Previous studies showed that sequence-order effects and physicochemical properties are important for representing protein sequences. However, how to use these kinds of information for constructing predictors is still a challenging problem. In this study, in order to incorporate the sequence-order information and physicochemical properties into the prediction, a method called disPseAAC is proposed, in which the feature vector is constructed by combining the occurrences of amino acid pairs within the Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) approach. The predictive performance and computational cost are further improved by employing the principal component analysis strategy. Various experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that disPseAAC achieves an ROC score of 0.922, outperforming some existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the learnt model can easily be analyzed in terms of discriminative features, and the computational cost of the proposed method is much lower than that of other profile-based methods.},

abstract = {We consider multi-label classification problems in application scenarios where classifier accuracy is not satisfactory, but manual annotation is too costly. In single-label problems, a well known solution consists of using a reject option, i.e., allowing a classifier to withhold unreliable decisions, leaving them (and only them) to human operators. We argue that this solution can be exploited also in multi-label problems. However, the current theoretical framework for classification with a reject option applies only to single-label problems. We thus develop a specific framework for multi-label ones. In particular, we extend multi-label accuracy measures to take into account rejections, and define manual annotation cost as a cost function. We then formalise the goal of attaining a desired trade-off between classifier accuracy on non-rejected decisions, and the cost of manually handling rejected decisions, as a constrained optimisation problem. We finally develop two possible implementations of our framework, tailored to the widely used F accuracy measure, and to the only cost models proposed so far for multi-label annotation tasks, and experimentally evaluate them on five application domains.},

The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

abstract = {Predicting subcellular localization of human proteins is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins may have a multiplex character, i.e., simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. In a previous study, we developed a predictor called "Hum-mPLoc" to deal with the multiplex problem for the human protein system. However, Hum-mPLoc has the following shortcomings. (1) The input of accession number for a query protein is required in order to obtain a higher expected success rate by selecting to use the higher-level prediction pathway; but many proteins, such as synthetic and hypothetical proteins as well as those newly discovered proteins without being deposited into databanks yet, do not have accession numbers. (2) Neither functional domain nor sequential evolution information were taken into account in Hum-mPLoc, and hence its power may be reduced accordingly. In view of this, a top-down strategy to address these shortcomings has been implemented. The new predictor thus obtained is called Hum-mPLoc 2.0, where the accession number for input is no longer needed whatsoever. Moreover, both the functional domain information and the sequential evolution information have been fused into the predictor by an ensemble classifier. As a consequence, the prediction power has been significantly enhanced. The web server of Hum-mPLoc2.0 is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/hum-multi-2/.},

To solve these problems, we constructed a data mart to reduce the size of stock data and combined fuzzification techniques with the grey theory to develop a fuzzy grey prediction as One of predicting functions in our system to predict the possible answer immediately. To demonstrate that our system is working correctly, we used our prediction system to analyse stock data and to predict the stock price promptly at a specific time.

During the past decades, many computational approaches have been proposed to solve this important task. These methods have made a substantial contribution to protein remote homology detection. Therefore, it is necessary to give a comprehensive review and comparison on these computational methods. In this article, we divide these computational approaches into three categories, including alignment methods, discriminative methods and ranking methods. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in a comprehensive perspective, and their performance is compared on widely used benchmark data sets. Finally, some open questions in this field are further explored and discussed.},

abstract = {Predicting phosphorylation protein is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins have multi-label features meaning that they may be phosphorylated at two or more different type amino acids. In fact, human protein usually be phosphorylated at serine, threonine and tyrosine. By introducing the "multi-label learning" approach, a novel predictor has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multi-label phosphorylation protein. Here we proposed a predictor called Multi-iPPseEvo by (1) incorporating the protein sequence evolutionary information into the general pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) via the grey system theory, (2) balancing out the skewed training datasets by the asymmetric bootstrap approach, and (3) constructing an ensemble predictor by fusing an array of individual random forest classifiers thru a voting system. Rigorous cross-validations via a set of multi-label metrics indicate that the multi-label phosphorylation predictor is very promising and encouraging. The current approach represents a new strategy to deal with the multi-label biological problems, and the software is freely available for academic use at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/Multi-iPPseEvo.},

This is true in particular for methods that appear to be defined in a non-local manner, such as support vector machines in classification and least-squares estimators in regression. Aside from showing that consistency implies a specific form of localizability, we also show that consistency is logically equivalent to the combination of two properties: (1) a form of localizability, and (2) that the method's global mean (over the entire X distribution) correctly estimates the true mean. Consistency can therefore be seen as comprised of two aspects, one local and one global.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular localization is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing methods can only be used to deal with the single-location proteins. Actually, multiple-location proteins should not be ignored because they usually bear some special functions worthy of our notice. By introducing the "multi-labeled learning" approach, a new predictor, called iLoc-Plant, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multiple-location plant proteins. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Plant on a benchmark dataset of plant proteins classified into the following 12 location sites: (1) cell membrane, (2) cell wall, (3) chloroplast, (4) cytoplasm, (5) endoplasmic reticulum, (6) extracellular, (7) Golgi apparatus, (8) mitochondrion, (9) nucleus, (10) peroxisome, (11) plastid, and (12) vacuole, where some proteins belong to two or three locations but none has {\textgreater}/= 25{\%} pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset. The overall success rate thus obtained by iLoc-Plant was 71{\%}, which is remarkably higher than those achieved by any existing predictors that also have the capacity to deal with such a stringent and complicated plant protein system. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Plant is freely accessible to the public at the web-site or . Moreover, for the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematic equations presented in this paper for its integrity. It is anticipated that iLoc-Plant may become a useful bioinformatics tool for Molecular Cell Biology, Proteomics, Systems Biology, and Drug Development.},

abstract = {As many structures of protein-DNA complexes have been known in the past years, several computational methods have been developed to predict DNA-binding sites in proteins. However, its inverse problem (i.e., predicting protein-binding sites in DNA) has received much less attention. One of the reasons is that the differences between the interaction propensities of nucleotides are much smaller than those between amino acids. Another reason is that DNA exhibits less diverse sequence patterns than protein. Therefore, predicting protein-binding DNA nucleotides is much harder than predicting DNA-binding amino acids. We computed the interaction propensity (IP) of nucleotide triplets with amino acids using an extensive dataset of protein-DNA complexes, and developed two support vector machine (SVM) models that predict protein-binding nucleotides from sequence data alone. One SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using DNA sequence data alone, and the other SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using both DNA and protein sequences. In a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences, the SVM model that uses DNA sequence data only predicted protein-binding nucleotides with an accuracy of 67.0{\%}, an F-measure of 67.1{\%}, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.340. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs that were not used in training, it achieved an accuracy of 66.2{\%}, an F-measure 66.3{\%} and a MCC of 0.324. Another SVM model that uses both DNA and protein sequences achieved an accuracy of 69.6{\%}, an F-measure of 69.6{\%}, and a MCC of 0.383 in a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences and 859 protein sequences. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs and 143 proteins, it showed an accuracy of 67.3{\%}, an F-measure of 66.5{\%} and a MCC of 0.329. Both in cross-validation and independent testing, the second SVM model that used both DNA and protein sequence data showed better performance than the first model that used DNA sequence data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict protein-binding nucleotides in a given DNA sequence from the sequence data alone.},

We introduce CpGenie, a sequence-based framework that learns a regulatory code of DNA methylation using a deep convolutional neural network and uses this network to predict the impact of sequence variation on proximal CpG site DNA methylation. CpGenie produces allele-specific DNA methylation prediction with single-nucleotide sensitivity that enables accurate prediction of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). We demonstrate that CpGenie prioritizes validated GWAS SNPs, and contributes to the prediction of functional non-coding variants, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and disease-associated mutations. CpGenie is publicly available to assist in identifying and interpreting regulatory non-coding variants.},

However, abuse of antimicrobial agents has accelerated the emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and there is an urgent need for novel antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted attention as a novel class of antimicrobial agents because AMPs efficiently kill a wide range of species, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, via a novel mechanism of action. In addition, they are effective against pathogens that are resistant to almost all conventional antibiotics. AMPs have promising properties; they directly disrupt the functions of cellular membranes and nucleic acids, and the rate of appearance of AMP-resistant strains is very low. However, as pharmaceuticals, AMPs exhibit unfavorable properties, such as instability, hemolytic activity, high cost of production, salt sensitivity, and a broad spectrum of activity. Therefore, it is vital to improve these properties to develop novel AMP treatments. Here, we have reviewed the basic biochemical properties of AMPs and the recent strategies used to modulate these properties of AMPs to enhance their safety.},

abstract = {Motivation: Translation initiation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to the annotated translation initiation sites (TISs), the translation process may also start at multiple alternative TISs (including both AUG and non-AUG codons), which makes it challenging to predict TISs and study the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Meanwhile, the advent of several high-throughput sequencing techniques for profiling initiating ribosomes at single-nucleotide resolution, e.g., GTI-seq and QTI-seq, provides abundant data for systematically studying the general principles of translation initiation and the development of computational method for TIS identification. Methods: We have developed a deep learning based framework, named TITER, for accurately predicting TISs on a genome-wide scale based on QTI-seq data. TITER extracts the sequence features of translation initiation from the surrounding sequence contexts of TISs using a hybrid neural network and further integrates the prior preference of TIS codon composition into a unified prediction framework. Results: Extensive tests demonstrated that TITER can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in identifying TISs. In addition, TITER was able to identify important sequence signatures for individual types of TIS codons, including a Kozak-sequence-like motif for AUG start codon. Furthermore, the TITER prediction score can be related to the strength of translation initiation in various biological scenarios, including the repressive effect of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on gene expression and the mutational effects influencing translation initiation efficiency.},

Therefore, novel function prediction methods that do not rely on sequence or fold similarity to other known proteins are needed. We present an automated approach to predict nucleic-acid-binding (NA-binding) proteins, specifically DNA-binding proteins. The method is based on characterizing the structural and sequence properties of large, positively charged electrostatic patches on DNA-binding protein surfaces, which typically coincide with the DNA-binding-sites. Using an ensemble of features extracted from these electrostatic patches, we predict DNA-binding proteins with high accuracy. We show that our method does not rely on sequence or structure homology and is capable of predicting proteins of novel-binding motifs and protein structures solved in an unbound state. Our method can also distinguish NA-binding proteins from other proteins that have similar, large positive electrostatic patches on their surfaces, but that do not bind nucleic acids.

This paper shows that binary relevance-based methods have much to offer, and that high predictive performance can be obtained without impeding scalability to large datasets. We exemplify this with a novel classifier chains method that can model label correlations while maintaining acceptable computational complexity. We extend this approach further in an ensemble framework. An extensive empirical evaluation covers a broad range of multi-label datasets with a variety of evaluation metrics.

abstract = {Most available antimicrobial peptides (AMP) prediction methods use common approach for different classes of AMP. Contrary to available approaches, we suggest that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact that there are several kinds of AMP that vary in mechanisms of action, structure, mode of interaction with membrane, etc. According to our suggestion for each kind of AMP, a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high efficacy. Consequently, in this paper, a particular but the biggest class of AMP, linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP), has been considered and a newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide in relation to membrane, charge density, propensities to disordered structure and aggregation were studied. On the basis of these characteristics, a new simple algorithm of prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors, hydrophobic moment, charge density and location of the peptide along the membranes, can be used as discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set, our method gives the same level of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP database service tools. For the test set accuracy obtained by our method gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools. The AMP prediction tool based on the considered method is available at http://www.biomedicine.org.ge/dbaasp/.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Increasing antibiotics resistance in human pathogens represents a pressing public health issue worldwide for which novel antibiotic therapies based on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may offer one possible solution. In the current study, we utilized publicly available data on AMPs to construct hidden Markov models (HMMs) that enable recognition of individual classes of antimicrobials peptides (such as defensins, cathelicidins, cecropins, etc.) with up to 99{\%} accuracy and can be used for discovering novel AMP candidates. RESULTS: HMM models for both mature peptides and propeptides were constructed. A total of 146 models for mature peptides and 40 for propeptides have been developed for individual AMP classes. These were created by clustering and analyzing AMP sequences available in the public sources and by consequent iterative scanning of the Swiss-Prot database for previously unknown gene-coded AMPs. As a result, an additional 229 additional AMPs have been identified from Swiss-Prot, and all but 34 could be associated with known antimicrobial activities according to the literature. The final set of 1045 mature peptides and 253 propeptides have been organized into the open-source AMPer database. AVAILABILITY: The developed HMM-based tools and AMP sequences can be accessed through the AMPer resource at http://www.cnbi2.com/cgi-bin/amp.pl},

abstract = {Multi-label learning is concerned with learning from data examples that are represented by a single feature vector while associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Existing multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations to facilitate the learning process. However, an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label learning, i.e., class-imbalance has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multi-label hypernetwork (TSMLHN) to exploit label correlations and to make use of them to address the class-imbalance problem in multi-label learning. In TSMLHN, labels of a multi-label data set are divided into two groups, i.e., imbalanced labels and common labels based on their imbalance ratios. In the first stage of TSMLHN, we train a multi-label hypernetwork (MLHN) which generates basic predictions for all labels. In the second stage of TSMLHN, we train TSMLHN based on the predictions obtained from MLHN and utilize the correlations between common labels and imbalanced labels to improve the learning performance of imbalanced labels. Our proposed TSMLHN is conceptually simple, yet it is effective in addressing the class-imbalance problem in multi-label learning. Empirical studies on a broad range of multi-label data sets demonstrate that TSMLHN achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms.},

@article{Silva2005,
abstract = {It is an experimental fact that gross topological parameters of the native structure of small proteins presenting two-state kinetics, as relative contact order chi, correlate with the logarithm of their respective folding rate constant kappa(f). However, reported results show specific cases for which the (chi,log kappa(f)) dependence does not follow the overall trend of the entire collection of experimental data. Therefore, an interesting point to be clarified is to what extent the native topology alone can explain these exceptional data. In this work, the structural determinants of the folding kinetics are investigated by means of a 27-mer lattice model, in that each native is represented by a compact self-avoiding (CSA) configuration. The hydrophobic effect and steric constraints are taken as basic ingredients of the folding mechanism, and each CSA configuration is characterized according to its composition of specific patterns (resembling basic structural elements such as loops, sheets, and helices). Our results suggest that (i) folding rate constants are largely influenced by topological details of the native structure, as configurational pattern types and their combinations, and (ii) global parameters, as the relative contact order, may not be effective to detect them. Distinct pattern types and their combinations are determinants of what we call here the "content of secondary-type" structure (sigma) of the native: high sigma implies a large kappa(f). The largest part of all CSA configurations presents a mix of distinct structural patterns, which determine the chixlog kappa(f) linear dependence: Those structures not presenting a proper chi-dependent balance of patterns have their folding kinetics affected with respect to the pretense linear correlation between chi and log kappa(f). The basic physical mechanism relating sigma and kappa(f) involves the concept of cooperativity: If the native is composed of patterns producing a spatial order rich in effective short-range contacts, a properly designed sequence undertakes a fast folding process. On the other hand, the presence of some structural patterns, such as long loops, may reduce substantially the folding performance. This fact is illustrated through natives having a very similar topology but presenting a distinct folding rate kappa(f), and by analyzing structures having the same chi but different sigma.},

abstract = {Some creatures living in extremely low temperatures can produce some special materials called "antifreeze proteins" (AFPs), which can prevent the cell and body fluids from freezing. AFPs are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, fungi, etc. Although AFPs have a common function, they show a high degree of diversity in sequences and structures. Therefore, sequence similarity based search methods often fails to predict AFPs from sequence databases. In this work, we report a random forest approach "AFP-Pred" for the prediction of antifreeze proteins from protein sequence. AFP-Pred was trained on the dataset containing 300 AFPs and 300 non-AFPs and tested on the dataset containing 181 AFPs and 9193 non-AFPs. AFP-Pred achieved 81.33{\%} accuracy from training and 83.38{\%} from testing. The performance of AFP-Pred was compared with BLAST and HMM. High prediction accuracy and successful of prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that AFP-Pred can be a useful approach to identify antifreeze proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibacterial peptides are one of the effecter molecules of innate immune system. Over the last few decades several antibacterial peptides have successfully approved as drug by FDA, which has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. In our recent study we analyzed 999 antibacterial peptides, which were collected from Antibacterial Peptide Database (APD). We have also developed methods to predict and classify these antibacterial peptides using Support Vector Machine (SVM). RESULTS: During analysis we observed that certain residues are preferred over other in antibacterial peptide, particularly at the N and C terminus. These observation and increased data of antibacterial peptide in APD encouraged us to again develop a new and more robust method for predicting antibacterial peptides in protein from their amino acid sequence or given peptide have antibacterial properties or not. First, the binary patterns of the 15 N terminus residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptide using SVM and achieved accuracy of 85.46{\%} with 0.705 Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Then we used the binary pattern of 15 C terminus residues and achieved accuracy of 85.05{\%} with 0.701 MCC, latter on we developed prediction method by combining N {\&} C terminus and achieved an accuracy of 91.64{\%} with 0.831 MCC. Finally we developed SVM based model using amino acid composition of whole peptide and achieved 92.14{\%} accuracy with MCC 0.843. In this study we used five-fold cross validation technique to develop all these models and tested the performance of these models on an independent dataset. We further classify antibacterial peptides according to their sources and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.95{\%}. We further classify antibacterial peptides in their respective family and got a satisfactory result. CONCLUSION: Among antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C terminus, which helps to discriminate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Amino acid composition of antibacterial peptides helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptide and their further classification in source and family. Antibp2 will be helpful in discovering efficacious antibacterial peptide, which we hope will be helpful against antibiotics resistant bacteria. We also developed user friendly web server for the biological community.},

abstract = {Pseudouridine is the most prevalent RNA modification and has been found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Currently, pseudouridine has been demonstrated in several kinds of RNAs, such as small nuclear RNA, rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, and small nucleolar RNA. Therefore, its significance to academic research and drug development is understandable. Through biochemical experiments, the pseudouridine site identification has produced good outcomes, but these lab exploratory methods and biochemical processes are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is important to introduce efficient methods for identification of pseudouridine sites. In this study, an intelligent method for pseudouridine sites using the deep-learning approach was developed. The proposed prediction model is called iPseU-CNN (identifying pseudouridine by convolutional neural networks). The existing methods used handcrafted features and machine-learning approaches to identify pseudouridine sites. However, the proposed predictor extracts the features of the pseudouridine sites automatically using a convolution neural network model. The iPseU-CNN model yields better outcomes than the current state-of-the-art models in all evaluation parameters. It is thus highly projected that the iPseU-CNN predictor will become a helpful tool for academic research on pseudouridine site prediction of RNA, as well as in drug discovery.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular localization is an important and difficult problem, particularly when query proteins may have the multiplex character, i.e., simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing protein subcellular location predictor can only be used to deal with the single-location or "singleplex" proteins. Actually, multiple-location or "multiplex" proteins should not be ignored because they usually posses some unique biological functions worthy of our special notice. By introducing the "multi-labeled learning" and "accumulation-layer scale", a new predictor, called iLoc-Euk, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both singleplex and multiplex proteins. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Euk on a benchmark dataset of eukaryotic proteins classified into the following 22 location sites: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) cell wall, (4) centriole, (5) chloroplast, (6) cyanelle, (7) cytoplasm, (8) cytoskeleton, (9) endoplasmic reticulum, (10) endosome, (11) extracellular, (12) Golgi apparatus, (13) hydrogenosome, (14) lysosome, (15) melanosome, (16) microsome (17) mitochondrion, (18) nucleus, (19) peroxisome, (20) spindle pole body, (21) synapse, and (22) vacuole, where none of proteins included has {\textgreater}/=25{\%} pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset. The overall success rate thus obtained by iLoc-Euk was 79{\%}, which is significantly higher than that by any of the existing predictors that also have the capacity to deal with such a complicated and stringent system. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Euk is freely accessible to the public at the web-site http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/iLoc-Euk. It is anticipated that iLoc-Euk may become a useful bioinformatics tool for Molecular Cell Biology, Proteomics, System Biology, and Drug Development Also, its novel approach will further stimulate the development of predicting other protein attributes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Study of drug-target interaction networks is an important topic for drug development. It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48{\%}, 80.78{\%}, 78.49{\%}, and 85.66{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the network prediction system thus established is quite promising and encouraging.},

In this paper, by introducing the "multi-label scale" and hybridizing the information of gene ontology with the sequential evolution information, a novel predictor called iLoc-Gneg is developed for predicting the subcellular localization of gram-positive bacterial proteins with both single-location and multiple-location sites. For facilitating comparison, the same stringent benchmark dataset used to estimate the accuracy of Gneg-mPLoc was adopted to demonstrate the power of iLoc-Gneg. The dataset contains 1,392 gram-negative bacterial proteins classified into the following eight locations: (1) cytoplasm, (2) extracellular, (3) fimbrium, (4) flagellum, (5) inner membrane, (6) nucleoid, (7) outer membrane, and (8) periplasm. Of the 1,392 proteins, 1,328 are each with only one subcellular location and the other 64 are each with two subcellular locations, but none of the proteins included has pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset (subcellular location). It was observed that the overall success rate by jackknife test on such a stringent benchmark dataset by iLoc-Gneg was over 91{\%}, which is about 6{\%} higher than that by Gneg-mPLoc.

abstract = {The secondary structure of an RNA is often implicit to its function. Recently, various high-throughput RNA structure probing techniques have been developed to elucidate important RNA structure–function relationships genome-wide. These techniques produce unwieldy experimental data sets that require evaluation with unique computational pipelines. Herein, we present StructureFold2, a user-friendly set of analysis tools that makes precise data processing and detailed downstream analyses of such data sets both available and practical. StructureFold2 processes high-throughput reads sequenced from libraries prepared after experimental probing for reverse transcription (RT) stops generated by chemical modification of RNA at solvent accessible residues. This pipeline is able to analyze reads generated from a variety of structure-probing chemicals (e.g. DMS, glyoxal, SHAPE). Notably, StructureFold2 offers a new fully featured suite of utilities and tools to guide a user through multiple types of analyses. A particular emphasis is placed on analyzing the reactivity patterns of transcripts, complementing their use as folding restraints for predicting RNA secondary structure. StructureFold2 is hosted as a Github repository and is available at (https://github.com/StructureFold2/StructureFold2).},

abstract = {The metabolic stability is a very important idiosyncracy of proteins that is related to their global flexibility, intramolecular fluctuations, various internal dynamic processes, as well as many marvelous biological functions. Determination of protein's metabolic stability would provide us with useful information for in-depth understanding of the dynamic action mechanisms of proteins. Although several experimental methods have been developed to measure protein's metabolic stability, they are time-consuming and more expensive. Reported in this paper is a computational method, which is featured by (1) integrating various properties of proteins, such as biochemical and physicochemical properties, subcellular locations, network properties and protein complex property, (2) using the mRMR (Maximum Relevance {\&} Minimum Redundancy) principle and the IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure to optimize the prediction engine, and (3) being able to identify proteins among the four types: "short", "medium", "long", and "extra-long" half-life spans. It was revealed through our analysis that the following seven characters played major roles in determining the stability of proteins: (1) KEGG enrichment scores of the protein and its neighbors in network, (2) subcellular locations, (3) polarity, (4) amino acids composition, (5) hydrophobicity, (6) secondary structure propensity, and (7) the number of protein complexes the protein involved. It was observed that there was an intriguing correlation between the predicted metabolic stability of some proteins and the real half-life of the drugs designed to target them. These findings might provide useful insights for designing protein-stability-relevant drugs. The computational method can also be used as a large-scale tool for annotating the metabolic stability for the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age.},

abstract = {Apoptosis proteins have a central role in the development and homeostasis of an organism. These proteins are very important for understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death. As a result of genome and other sequencing projects, the gap between the number of known apoptosis protein sequences and the number of known apoptosis protein structures is widening rapidly. Because of this extremely unbalanced state, it would be worthwhile to develop a fast and reliable method to identify their subcellular locations so as to gain better insight into their biological functions. In view of this, a new method, in which the support vector machine combines with discrete wavelet transform, has been developed to predict the subcellular location of apoptosis proteins. The results obtained by the jackknife test were quite promising, and indicated that the proposed method can remarkably improve the prediction accuracy of subcellular locations, and might also become a useful high-throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily according to their sequences.},

abstract = {Deep learning is one of the most powerful machine learning methods that has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many domains. Since deep learning was introduced to the field of bioinformatics in 2012, it has achieved success in a number of areas such as protein residue-residue contact prediction, secondary structure prediction, and fold recognition. In this work, we developed deep learning methods to improve the prediction of torsion (dihedral) angles of proteins. We design four different deep learning architectures to predict protein torsion angles. The architectures including deep neural network (DNN) and deep restricted Boltzmann machine (DRBN), deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and deep recurrent restricted Boltzmann machine (DReRBM) since the protein torsion angle prediction is a sequence related problem. In addition to existing protein features, two new features (predicted residue contact number and the error distribution of torsion angles extracted from sequence fragments) are used as input to each of the four deep learning architectures to predict phi and psi angles of protein backbone. The mean absolute error (MAE) of phi and psi angles predicted by DRNN, DReRBM, DRBM and DNN is about 20–21° and 29–30° on an independent dataset. The MAE of phi angle is comparable to the existing methods, but the MAE of psi angle is 29°, 2° lower than the existing methods. On the latest CASP12 targets, our methods also achieved the performance better than or comparable to a state-of-the art method. Our experiment demonstrates that deep learning is a valuable method for predicting protein torsion angles. The deep recurrent network architecture performs slightly better than deep feed-forward architecture, and the predicted residue contact number and the error distribution of torsion angles extracted from sequence fragments are useful features for improving prediction accuracy.},

Sequence similarity and domain architecture searches are combined with protein-protein interaction network data to derive consensus predictions for GO terms using functional enrichment. The INGA server can be queried both programmatically through RESTful services and through a web interface designed for usability. The latter provides output supporting the GO term predictions with the annotating sequences.

abstract = {Successful planning of a solid waste management system depends critically on the prediction accuracy of solid waste generation. But the prediction condition of generation trend in many developing countries is quite different from those in developed countries. The lack of sampling and analysis in many developing countries due to insufficient budget and unavailable management task force has resulted in a situation where the historical record of solid waste generation and composition can never be completed in the long term. To effectively handle these problems with only limited samples and fulfil the prediction analysis of solid waste generation with reasonable accuracy, a special analytical technique must be developed and applied before the subsequent system planning for urban solid waste management is carried out. This study presents a new theory - grey fuzzy dynamic modeling - for the prediction of solid waste generation in the urban area based on a set of limited samples. The practical implementation has been accessed by a case study in the city of Tainan in Taiwan. It shows that such a new forecasting technique may achieve better prediction accuracy than those of the conventional grey dynamic model, least-squares regression method, and the fuzzy goal regression technique.

abstract = {To design and discover new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with high levels of antimicrobial activity, a number of machine-learning methods and prediction methods have been developed. Here, we present a new prediction method that can identify novel AMPs that are highly similar in sequence to known peptides but offer improved antimicrobial activity along with lower host cytotoxicity. Using previously generated AMP amino acid substitution data, we developed an amino acid activity contribution matrix that contained an activity contribution value for each amino acid in each position of the model peptide. A series of AMPs were designed with this method. After evaluating the antimicrobial activities of these novel AMPs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, DP7 was chosen for further analysis. Compared to the parent peptide HH2, this novel AMP showed broad-spectrum, improved antimicrobial activity, and in a cytotoxicity assay it showed lower toxicity against human cells. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of DP7 was tested in a Staphylococcus aureus infection murine model. When inoculated and treated via intraperitoneal injection, DP7 reduced the bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage solution. Electron microscope imaging and the results indicated disruption of the S. aureus outer membrane by DP7. Our new prediction method can therefore be employed to identify AMPs possessing minor amino acid differences with improved antimicrobial activities, potentially increasing the therapeutic agents available to combat multidrug-resistant infections.},

abstract = {One of the most important challenges in computational and molecular biology is to understand the relationship between amino acid sequences and the folding rates of proteins. Recent works suggest that topological parameters, amino acid properties, chain length and the composition index relate well with protein folding rates, however, sequence order information has seldom been considered as a property for predicting protein folding rates. In this study, amino acid sequence order was used to derive an effective method, based on an extended version of the pseudo-amino acid composition, for predicting protein folding rates without any explicit structural information. Using the jackknife cross validation test, the method was demonstrated on the largest dataset (99 proteins) reported. The method was found to provide a good correlation between the predicted and experimental folding rates. The correlation coefficient is 0.81 (with a highly significant level) and the standard error is 2.46. The reported algorithm was found to perform better than several representative sequence-based approaches using the same dataset. The results indicate that sequence order information is an important determinant of protein folding rates.},

The first one is to present specialized measures directed to assess the imbalance level in multilabel datasets (MLDs). Using these measures we will be able to conclude which MLDs are imbalanced, and therefore would need an appropriate treatment The second objective is to propose several algorithms designed to reduce the imbalance in MLDs in a classifier-independent way, by means of resampling techniques. Two different approaches to divide the instances in minority and majority groups are studied. One of them considers each label combination as class identifier, whereas the other one performs an individual evaluation of each label imbalance level. A random undersampling and a random oversampling algorithm are proposed for each approach, giving as result four different algorithms. All of them are experimentally tested and their effectiveness is statistically evaluated. From the results obtained, a set of guidelines directed to show when these methods should be applied is also provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

But more efficient methods are needed still. Hypergraph may not be powerful enough to deal with the data in boundary region, although it is an efficient tool to knowledge discovery. In this paper, the neighborhood hypergraph is presented, combining rough set theory and hypergraph. After that, a novel classification algorithm for imbalance data based on neighborhood hypergraph is developed, which is composed of three steps: initialization of hyperedge, classification of training data set, and substitution of hyperedge. After conducting an experiment of 10-fold cross validation on 18 data sets, the proposed algorithm has higher average accuracy than others.},

These tasks are important for brain imaging and neuroscience discovery, making the methods attractive for porting to a neuroimager's toolbox. Success of these methods is, in part, explained by the flexibility of deep learning models. However, this flexibility makes the process of porting to new areas a difficult parameter optimization problem. In this work we demonstrate our results (and feasible parameter ranges) in application of deep learning methods to structural and functional brain imaging data. These methods include deep belief networks and their building block the restricted Boltzmann machine. We also describe a novel constraint-based approach to visualizing high dimensional data. We use it to analyze the effect of parameter choices on data transformations. Our results show that deep learning methods are able to learn physiologically important representations and detect latent relations in neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new local-global pattern classification scheme that combines supervised and unsupervised approaches, taking advantage of both, local and global environments. We understand as global methods the ones concerned with the aim of constructing a model for the whole problem space using the totality of the available observations. Local methods focus into sub regions of the space, possibly using an appropriately selected subset of the sample. In the proposed method, the sample is first divided in local cells by using a Vector Quantization unsupervised algorithm, the LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray). In a second stage, the generated assemblage of much easier problems is locally solved with a scheme inspired by Bayes' rule. Four classification methods were implemented for comparison purposes with the proposed scheme: Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ); Feedforward Neural Networks: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors. These four methods and the proposed scheme were implemented in eleven datasets, two controlled experiments, plus nine public available datasets from the UCI repository. The proposed method has shown a quite competitive performance when compared to these classical and largely used classifiers. Our method is simple concerning understanding and implementation and is based on very intuitive concepts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.},

abstract = {It is well known that an important step toward understanding the functions of a protein is to determine its subcellular location. Although numerous prediction algorithms have been developed, most of them typically focused on the proteins with only one location. In recent years, researchers have begun to pay attention to the subcellular localization prediction of the proteins with multiple sites. However, almost all the existing approaches have failed to take into account the correlations among the locations caused by the proteins with multiple sites, which may be the important information for improving the prediction accuracy of the proteins with multiple sites. In this paper, a new algorithm which can effectively exploit the correlations among the locations is proposed by using Gaussian process model. Besides, the algorithm also can realize optimal linear combination of various feature extraction technologies and could be robust to the imbalanced data set. Experimental results on a human protein data set show that the proposed algorithm is valid and can achieve better performance than the existing approaches.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular localization is an important and difficult problem, particularly when query proteins may have the multiplex character, i.e., simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing protein subcellular location predictor can only be used to deal with the single-location or "singleplex" proteins. Actually, multiple-location or "multiplex" proteins should not be ignored because they usually posses some unique biological functions worthy of our special notice. By introducing the "multi-labeled learning" and "accumulation-layer scale", a new predictor, called iLoc-Euk, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both singleplex and multiplex proteins. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Euk on a benchmark dataset of eukaryotic proteins classified into the following 22 location sites: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) cell wall, (4) centriole, (5) chloroplast, (6) cyanelle, (7) cytoplasm, (8) cytoskeleton, (9) endoplasmic reticulum, (10) endosome, (11) extracellular, (12) Golgi apparatus, (13) hydrogenosome, (14) lysosome, (15) melanosome, (16) microsome (17) mitochondrion, (18) nucleus, (19) peroxisome, (20) spindle pole body, (21) synapse, and (22) vacuole, where none of proteins included has {\textgreater}/=25{\%} pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset. The overall success rate thus obtained by iLoc-Euk was 79{\%}, which is significantly higher than that by any of the existing predictors that also have the capacity to deal with such a complicated and stringent system. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Euk is freely accessible to the public at the web-site http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/iLoc-Euk. It is anticipated that iLoc-Euk may become a useful bioinformatics tool for Molecular Cell Biology, Proteomics, System Biology, and Drug Development Also, its novel approach will further stimulate the development of predicting other protein attributes.},

The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {Apoptosis proteins have a central role in the development and the homeostasis of an organism. These proteins are very important for understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death. The function of an apoptosis protein is closely related to its subcellular location. It is crucial to develop powerful tools to predict apoptosis protein locations for rapidly increasing gap between the number of known structural proteins and the number of known sequences in protein databank. In this study, amino acids pair compositions with different spaces are used to construct feature sets for representing sample of protein feature selection approach based on binary particle swarm optimization, which is applied to extract effective feature. Ensemble classifier is used as prediction engine, of which the basic classifier is the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor. Each basic classifier is trained with different feature sets. Two datasets often used in prior works are selected to validate the performance of proposed approach. The results obtained by jackknife test are quite encouraging, indicating that the proposed method might become a potentially useful tool for subcellular location of apoptosis protein, or at least can play a complimentary role to the existing methods in the relevant areas.

abstract = {In the field of statistical discrimination nearest neighbor methods are a well known, quite simple but successful nonparametric classification tool If the number of predictors increases, however, predictive power normally deteriorates. In general. if some covariates are assumed to be noise variables. variable selection is a promising approach. The paper's main focus is on the development and evaluation of a nearest neighbor ensemble with implicit variable selection. In contrast to other nearest neighbor approaches we are not primarily interested in classification, but in estimating the (posterior) class probabilities. In simulation studies and for real world data the proposed nearest neighbor ensemble is compared to an extended forward/backward variable selection procedure for nearest neighbor classifiers, and some alternative well established classification tools (that offer probability estimates as well). Despite its simple structure, the proposed method's performance is quite good - especially if relevant covariates can be separated from noise variables. Another advantage of the presented ensemble is the easy identification of interactions that are usually hard to detect. So not simply variable selection but rather some kind of feature selection is performed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Background: The functions of proteins are closely related to their subcellular locations. In the post-genomics era, the amount of gene and protein data grows exponentially, which necessitates the prediction of subcellular localization by computational means. Results: This paper proposes mitigating the computation burden of alignment-based approaches to subcellular localization prediction by a cascaded fusion of cleavage site prediction and profile alignment. Specifically, the informative segments of protein sequences are identified by a cleavage site predictor using the information in their N-terminal shorting signals. Then, the sequences are truncated at the cleavage site positions, and the shortened sequences are passed to PSI-BLAST for computing their profiles. Subcellular localization are subsequently predicted by a profile-to-profile alignment support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier. To further reduce the training and recognition time of the classifier, the SVM classifier is replaced by a new kernel method based on the perturbational discriminant analysis (PDA). Conclusions: Experimental results on a new dataset based on Swiss-Prot Release 57.5 show that the method can make use of the best property of signal-and homology-based approaches and can attain an accuracy comparable to that achieved by using full-length sequences. Analysis of profile-alignment score matrices suggest that both profile creation time and profile alignment time can be reduced without significant reduction in subcellular localization accuracy. It was found that PDA enjoys a short training time as compared to the conventional SVM. We advocate that the method will be important for biologists to conduct large-scale protein annotation or for bioinformaticians to perform preliminary investigations on new algorithms that involve pairwise alignments.},

abstract = {Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially noncoding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. CADD is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and noncoding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture nonlinear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture nonlinear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit CUDA-compatible GPUs and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19{\%} relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14{\%} relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD's SVM methodology.Availability and implementation: All data and source code are available at https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public{\_}data/DANN/.Contact: xhx@ics.uci.edu},

abstract = {Protein subcellular localization is concerned with predicting the location of a protein within a cell using computational methods. The location information can indicate key functionalities of proteins. Thus, accurate prediction of subcellular localizations of proteins can help the prediction of protein functions and genome annotations, as well as the identification of drug targets. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been used in the past for the problem of protein subcellular localization, but have been shown to suffer from a lack of annotated training data in each species under study. To overcome this data sparsity problem, we observe that because some of the organisms may be related to each other, there may be some commonalities across different organisms that can be discovered and used to help boost the data in each localization task. In this paper, we formulate protein subcellular localization problem as one of multitask learning across different organisms. We adapt and compare two specializations of the multitask learning algorithms on 20 different organisms. Our experimental results show that multitask learning performs much better than the traditional single-task methods. Among the different multitask learning methods, we found that the multitask kernels and supertype kernels under multitask learning that share parameters perform slightly better than multitask learning by sharing latent features. The most significant improvement in terms of localization accuracy is about 25 percent. We find that if the organisms are very different or are remotely related from a biological point of view, then jointly training the multiple models cannot lead to significant improvement. However, if they are closely related biologically, the multitask learning can do much better than individual learning.},

abstract = {The function of a protein is generally related to its subcellular localization. Therefore, knowing its subcellular localization is helpful in understanding its potential functions and roles in biological processes. This work develops a hybrid method for computationally predicting the subcellular localization of eukaryotic protein. The method is called EuLoc and incorporates the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method, homology search approach and the support vector machines (SVM) method by fusing several new features into Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition. The proposed SVM module overcomes the shortcoming of the homology search approach in predicting the subcellular localization of a protein which only finds low-homologous or non-homologous sequences in a protein subcellular localization annotated database. The proposed HMM modules overcome the shortcoming of SVM in predicting subcellular localizations using few data on protein sequences. Several features of a protein sequence are considered, including the sequence-based features, the biological features derived from PROSITE, NLSdb and Pfam, the post-transcriptional modification features and others. The overall accuracy and location accuracy of EuLoc are 90.5 and 91.2 {\%}, respectively, revealing a better predictive performance than obtained elsewhere. Although the amounts of data of the various subcellular location groups in benchmark dataset differ markedly, the accuracies of 12 subcellular localizations of EuLoc range from 82.5 to 100 {\%}, indicating that this tool is much more balanced than other tools. EuLoc offers a high, balanced predictive power for each subcellular localization. EuLoc is now available on the web at http://euloc.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.},

To identify the sequence and structural properties critical for antimicrobial activity, a series of peptides varying in sequence, length, hydrophobicity/charge ratio, and secondary structure, were designed and synthesized. Their antimicrobial activities were then tested using Escherichiacoli and HEK293 cells, together with several index activities against model membrane, including liposome leakage, fusion, and aggregation. While no evident correlation between the antimicrobial activity and the property of the peptides was observed, common activities against model membrane were nevertheless identified for the active antimicrobial peptides: mediating efficient membrane leakage, negligible membrane fusion and liposome aggregation. Therefore, in addition to identifying one highly active antimicrobial peptide, our study further sheds light on the design principle for these molecules.},

abstract = {As one of the most ubiquitous post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays an essential role in many vital biological processes. The identification of m6A sites in RNAs is significantly important for both basic biomedical research and practical drug development. In this study, we designed a computational-based method, called TargetM6A, to rapidly and accurately target m6A sites solely from the primary RNA sequences. Two new features, i.e., position-specific nucleotide/dinucleotide propensities (PSNP/PSDP), are introduced and combined with the traditional nucleotide composition (NC) feature to formulate RNA sequences. The extracted features are further optimized to obtain a much more compact and discriminative feature subset by applying an incremental feature selection (IFS) procedure. Based on the optimized feature subset, we trained TargetM6A on the training dataset with a support vector machine (SVM) as the prediction engine. We compared the proposed TargetM6A method with existing methods for predicting m6A sites by performing stringent jackknife tests and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Target M6A method outperformed the existing methods for predicting m6A sites and remarkably improved the prediction performances, with MCC = 0.526 and AUC = 0.818. We also provided a user-friendly web server for TargetM6A, which is publicly accessible for academic use at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/TargetM6A.},

abstract = {Biological sequences are composed of long strings of alphabetic letters rather than arrays of numerical values. Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.},

abstract = {Identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) is important in the computational inference of gene regulation. Widely used computational methods of TFBS prediction based on position weight matrices (PWMs) usually have high false positive rates. Moreover, computational studies of transcription regulation in eukaryotes frequently require numerous PWM models of TFBSs due to a large number of TFs involved. To overcome these problems we developed DRAF, a novel method for TFBS prediction that requires only 14 prediction models for 232 human TFs, while at the same time significantly improves prediction accuracy. DRAF models use more features than PWM models, as they combine information from TFBS sequences and physicochemical properties of TF DNA-binding domains into machine learning models. Evaluation of DRAF on 98 human ChIP-seq datasets shows on average 1.54-, 1.96- and 5.19-fold reduction of false positives at the same sensitivities compared to models from HOCOMOCO, TRANSFAC and DeepBind, respectively. This observation suggests that one can efficiently replace the PWM models for TFBS prediction by a small number of DRAF models that significantly improve prediction accuracy. The DRAF method is implemented in a web tool and in a stand-alone software freely available at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/DRAF.},

abstract = {Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on 'shallow' machine-learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions of the inputs, and rely on a painstaking search through manually constructed nonlinear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Here, using benchmark data sets, we show that deep-learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8{\%} over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep-learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.},

abstract = {Preference learning is an emerging topic that appears in different guises in the recent literature. This work focuses on a particular learning scenario called label ranking, where the problem is to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a finite number of labels. Our approach for learning such a mapping, called ranking by pairwise comparison (RPC), first induces a binary preference relation from suitable training data using a natural extension of pairwise classification. A ranking is then derived from the preference relation thus obtained by means of a ranking procedure, whereby different ranking methods can be used for minimizing different loss functions. In particular, we show that a simple (weighted) voting strategy minimizes risk with respect to the well-known Spearman rank correlation. We compare RPC to existing label ranking methods, which are based on scoring individual labels instead of comparing pairs of labels. Both empirically and theoretically, it is shown that RPC is superior in terms of computational efficiency, and at least competitive in terms of accuracy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accomplishment of the various genome sequencing projects resulted in accumulation of massive amount of gene sequence information. This calls for a large-scale computational method for predicting protein localization from sequence. The protein localization can provide valuable information about its molecular function, as well as the biological pathway in which it participates. The prediction of localization of a protein at subnuclear level is a challenging task. In our previous work we proposed an SVM-based system using protein sequence information for this prediction task. In this work, we assess protein similarity with Gene Ontology (GO) and then improve the performance of the system by adding a module of nearest neighbor classifier using a similarity measure derived from the GO annotation terms for protein sequences. RESULTS: The performance of the new system proposed here was compared with our previous system using a set of proteins resided within 6 localizations collected from the Nuclear Protein Database (NPD). The overall MCC (accuracy) is elevated from 0.284 (50.0{\%}) to 0.519 (66.5{\%}) for single-localization proteins in leave-one-out cross-validation; and from 0.420 (65.2{\%}) to 0.541 (65.2{\%}) for an independent set of multi-localization proteins. The new system is available at http://array.bioengr.uic.edu/subnuclear.htm. CONCLUSION: The prediction of protein subnuclear localizations can be largely influenced by various definitions of similarity for a pair of proteins based on different similarity measures of GO terms. Using the sum of similarity scores over the matched GO term pairs for two proteins as the similarity definition produced the best predictive outcome. Substantial improvement in predicting protein subnuclear localizations has been achieved by combining Gene Ontology with sequence information.},

Dealing with imbalance by means of resampling methods is an approach that has been deeply studied lately, primarily in the context of traditional (non-multilabel) classification. In this paper the process of synthetic instance generation for multilabel datasets (MLDs) is studied and MLSMOTE (Multilabel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a new algorithm aimed to produce synthetic instances for imbalanced MLDs, is proposed. An extensive review on how imbalance in the multilabel context has been tackled in the past is provided, along with a thorough experimental study aimed to verify the benefits of the proposed algorithm. Several multilabel classification algorithms and other multilabel oversampling methods are considered, as well as ensemble-based algorithms for imbalanced multilabel classification. The empirical analysis shows that MLSMOTE is able to improve the classification results produced by existent proposals.},

abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidencetheoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab-Signal-3L.xls", and will be updated once a year to include new protein entries and reflect the continuous development of Signal-3L.

However, the development of integrative approaches to complement gene expression (GE) data with other types of gene information, such as copy number (CN) and chromosomal localization, still represents a computational challenge in the genomic arena. This work presents a computational procedure that directly integrates CN and GE profiles at genome-wide level. When applied to DNA/RNA paired data, this approach leads to the identification of Significant Overlaps of Differentially Expressed and Genomic Imbalanced Regions (SODEGIR). This goal is accomplished in three steps. The first step extends to CN a method for detecting regional imbalances in GE. The second part provides the integration of CN and GE data and identifies chromosomal regions with concordantly altered genomic and transcriptional status in a tumor sample. The last step elevates the single-sample analysis to an entire dataset of tumor specimens. When applied to study chromosomal aberrations in a collection of astrocytoma and renal carcinoma samples, the procedure proved to be effective in identifying discrete chromosomal regions of coordinated CN alterations and changes in transcriptional levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Gene Ontology is a controlled vocabulary for representing knowledge related to genes and proteins in a computable form. The current effort of manually annotating proteins with the Gene Ontology is outpaced by the rate of accumulation of biomedical knowledge in literature, which urges the development of text mining approaches to facilitate the process by automatically extracting the Gene Ontology annotation from literature. The task is usually cast as a text classification problem, and contemporary methods are confronted with unbalanced training data and the difficulties associated with multi-label classification. RESULTS: In this research, we investigated the methods of enhancing automatic multi-label classification of biomedical literature by utilizing the structure of the Gene Ontology graph. We have studied three graph-based multi-label classification algorithms, including a novel stochastic algorithm and two top-down hierarchical classification methods for multi-label literature classification. We systematically evaluated and compared these graph-based classification algorithms to a conventional flat multi-label algorithm. The results indicate that, through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods can significantly improve predictions of the Gene Ontology terms implied by the analyzed text. Furthermore, the graph-based multi-label classifiers are capable of suggesting Gene Ontology annotations (to curators) that are closely related to the true annotations even if they fail to predict the true ones directly. A software package implementing the studied algorithms is available for the research community. CONCLUSION: Through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods have better potential than the conventional flat multi-label classification approach to facilitate protein annotation based on the literature.},

Although experimental and predicted data for protein SCL are archived in various databases, SCL prediction remains a non-trivial problem in genome annotation. Current SCL prediction tools use amino-acid sequence features and text mining approaches. A comprehensive analysis of protein SCL in human PPI and metabolic networks for various subcellular compartments is necessary for developing a robust SCL prediction methodology. Results: Based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) and metabolite-linked protein interaction (MLPI) networks of proteins, we have compared, contrasted and analysed the statistical properties across different subcellular compartments. We integrated PPI and metabolic datasets with SCL information of human proteins from LOCATE and GOA (Gene Ontology Annotation) and estimated three statistical properties: Chi-square (chi(2)) test, Paired Localisation Correlation Profile (PLCP) and network topological measures. For the PPI network, Pearson's chi-square test shows that for the same SCL category, twice as many interacting protein pairs are observed than estimated when compared to non-interacting protein pairs (chi(2) = 1270.19, P-value {\textless}2.2 x 10(-16)), whereas for MLPI, metabolite-linked protein pairs having the same SCL are observed 20{\%} more than expected, compared to non-metabolite linked proteins (chi(2) = 110.02, P-value {\textless}2.2 x 10(-16)). To address the issue of proteins with multiple SCLs, we have specifically used the PLCP (Pair Localization Correlation Profile) measure. PLCP analysis revealed that protein interactions are majorly restricted to the same SCL, though significant cross-compartment interactions are seen for nuclear proteins. Metabolite-linked protein pairs are restricted to specific compartments such as the mitochondrion (P-value {\textless}6.0e-07), the lysosome (P-value {\textless}4.7e-05) and the Golgi apparatus (P-value {\textless}1.0e-15). These findings indicate that the metabolic network adds value to the information in the PPI network for the localisation process of proteins in human subcellular compartments. Conclusions: The MLPI network differs significantly from the PPI network in its SCL distribution. The PPI network shows passive protein interaction, possibly due to its high false positive rate, across different subcellular compartments, which seem to be absent in the MLPI network, as the MLPI network has evolved to maintain high substrate specificity for proteins.},

abstract = {As fundamental components in innate immunity, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potentials in the treatment of persistent infections involving slow-growing or dormant bacteria in which, selective inhibition of prokaryotic bacteria in the context of eukaryotic cells is not only an essential requirement, but also a critical challenge in the development of antimicrobial peptides. To identify the sequence and structural properties critical for antimicrobial activity, a series of peptides varying in sequence, length, hydrophobicity/charge ratio, and secondary structure, were designed and synthesized. Their antimicrobial activities were then tested using Escherichiacoli and HEK293 cells, together with several index activities against model membrane, including liposome leakage, fusion, and aggregation. While no evident correlation between the antimicrobial activity and the property of the peptides was observed, common activities against model membrane were nevertheless identified for the active antimicrobial peptides: mediating efficient membrane leakage, negligible membrane fusion and liposome aggregation. Therefore, in addition to identifying one highly active antimicrobial peptide, our study further sheds light on the design principle for these molecules.},

More recently, results suggest that DBS can enhance memory for facts and events that are dependent on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), thus raising the possibility for DBS to be used as a treatment for MTL- related neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and MTL injuries). In the following review, we summarize key results that show the ability of DBS or cortical surface stimulation to enhance memory. We also discuss current knowledge regarding the temporal specificity, underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of action, and generalization of stimulation's effects on memory. Throughout our discussion, we also propose several future directions that will provide the necessary insight into if and how DBS could be used as a therapeutic treatment for memory disorders.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibacterial peptides are one of the effecter molecules of innate immune system. Over the last few decades several antibacterial peptides have successfully approved as drug by FDA, which has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. In our recent study we analyzed 999 antibacterial peptides, which were collected from Antibacterial Peptide Database (APD). We have also developed methods to predict and classify these antibacterial peptides using Support Vector Machine (SVM). RESULTS: During analysis we observed that certain residues are preferred over other in antibacterial peptide, particularly at the N and C terminus. These observation and increased data of antibacterial peptide in APD encouraged us to again develop a new and more robust method for predicting antibacterial peptides in protein from their amino acid sequence or given peptide have antibacterial properties or not. First, the binary patterns of the 15 N terminus residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptide using SVM and achieved accuracy of 85.46{\%} with 0.705 Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Then we used the binary pattern of 15 C terminus residues and achieved accuracy of 85.05{\%} with 0.701 MCC, latter on we developed prediction method by combining N {\&} C terminus and achieved an accuracy of 91.64{\%} with 0.831 MCC. Finally we developed SVM based model using amino acid composition of whole peptide and achieved 92.14{\%} accuracy with MCC 0.843. In this study we used five-fold cross validation technique to develop all these models and tested the performance of these models on an independent dataset. We further classify antibacterial peptides according to their sources and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.95{\%}. We further classify antibacterial peptides in their respective family and got a satisfactory result. CONCLUSION: Among antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C terminus, which helps to discriminate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Amino acid composition of antibacterial peptides helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptide and their further classification in source and family. Antibp2 will be helpful in discovering efficacious antibacterial peptide, which we hope will be helpful against antibiotics resistant bacteria. We also developed user friendly web server for the biological community.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Enhancers are of short regulatory DNA elements. They can be bound with proteins (activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a critical role in promoting gene transcription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is a challenging task to develop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely complicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, they were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an enhancer or not. According to the distinct levels of biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes, however, enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength. RESULTS: In view of this, a two-layer predictor called ' IENHANCER-2L: ' was proposed by formulating DNA elements with the 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', into which the six DNA local parameters were incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated that IENHANCER-2L: holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for the two-layer predictor was established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

Over the last few decades, the search for new drugs and drug targets has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. We analyzed 486 antibacterial peptides, obtained from antimicrobial peptide database APD, in order to understand the preference of amino acid residues at specific positions in these peptides. RESULTS: It was observed that certain types of residues are preferred over others in antibacterial peptides, particularly at the N and C terminus. These observations encouraged us to develop a method for predicting antibacterial peptides in proteins from their amino acid sequence. First, the N-terminal residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptides using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quantitative Matrices (QM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which resulted in an accuracy of 83.63{\%}, 84.78{\%} and 87.85{\%}, respectively. Then, the C-terminal residues were used for developing prediction methods, which resulted in an accuracy of 77.34{\%}, 82.03{\%} and 85.16{\%} using ANN, QM and SVM, respectively. Finally, ANN, QM and SVM models were developed using N and C terminal residues, which achieved an accuracy of 88.17{\%}, 90.37{\%} and 92.11{\%}, respectively. All the models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. These models were also tested on an independent or blind dataset. CONCLUSION: Among antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C termini, which helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Both the termini play a crucial role in imparting the antibacterial property to these peptides. Among the methods developed, SVM shows the best performance in predicting antibacterial peptides followed by QM and ANN, in that order. AntiBP (Antibacterial peptides) will help in discovering efficacious antibacterial peptides, which we hope will prove to be a boon to combat the dreadful antibiotic resistant bacteria.

abstract = {The hypothesis that folding robustness is the primary determinant of the evolution rate of proteins is explored using a coarse-grained off-lattice model. The simplicity of the model allows rapid computation of the folding probability of a sequence to any folded conformation. For each robust folder, the network of sequences that share its native structure is identified. The fitness of a sequence is postulated to be a simple function of the number of misfolded molecules that have to be produced to reach a characteristic protein abundance. After fixation probabilities of mutants are computed under a simple population dynamics model, a Markov chain on the fold network is constructed, and the fold-averaged evolution rate is computed. The distribution of the logarithm of the evolution rates across distinct networks exhibits a peak with a long tail on the low rate side and resembles the universal empirical distribution of the evolutionary rates more closely than either distribution resembles the log-normal distribution. The results suggest that the universal distribution of the evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes is a direct consequence of the basic physics of protein folding.},

abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had g25{\%} sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6{\%} and 83.7{\%}, respectively, which were 46 similar to 63{\%} higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss- Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called " Euk- OET- PLoc", has been designed at http:// 202.120.37.186/ bioinf/ euk- oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET- KNN classifier.},

abstract = {Protein remote homology detection is an important task in computational proteomics. Some computational methods have been proposed, which detect remote homology proteins based on different features and algorithms. As noted in previous studies, their predictive results are complementary to each other. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore whether these methods can be combined into one package so as to further enhance the performance power and application convenience. In view of this, we introduced a protein representation called profile-based pseudo protein sequence to extract the evolutionary information from the relevant profiles. Based on the concept of pseudo proteins, a new predictor, called “dRHP-PseRA”, was developed by combining four state-of-the-art predictors (PSI-BLAST, HHblits, Hmmer, and Coma) via the rank aggregation approach. Cross-validation tests on a SCOP benchmark dataset have demonstrated that the new predictor has remarkably outperformed any of the existing methods for the same purpose on ROC50 scores. Accordingly, it is anticipated that dRHP-PseRA holds very high potential to become a useful high throughput tool for detecting remote homology proteins.

abstract = {The knowledge of subnuclear localization in eukaryotic cells is essential for understanding the life function of nucleus. Developing prediction methods and tools for proteins subnuclear localization become important research fields in protein science for special characteristics in cell nuclear. In this study, a novel approach has been proposed to predict protein subnuclear localization. Sample of protein is represented by Pseudo Amino Acid (PseAA) composition based on approximate entropy (ApEn) concept, which reflects the complexity of time series. A novel ensemble classifier is designed incorporating three AdaBoost classifiers. The base classifier algorithms in three AdaBoost are decision stumps, fuzzy K nearest neighbors classifier, and radial basis-support vector machines, respectively. Different PseAA compositions are used as input data of different AdaBoost classifier in ensemble. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the dimension and weight factor of PseAA composition. Two datasets often used in published works are used to validate the performance of the proposed approach. The obtained results of Jackknife cross-validation test are higher and more balance than them of other methods on same datasets. The promising results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and practical. It might become a useful tool in protein subnuclear localization.

abstract = {We propose a novel approach for categorizing text documents based on the use of a special kernel. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space generated by all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences that are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique.},

abstract = {Successful planning of a solid waste management system depends critically on the prediction accuracy of solid waste generation. But the prediction condition of generation trend in many developing countries is quite different from those in developed countries. The lack of sampling and analysis in many developing countries due to insufficient budget and unavailable management task force has resulted in a situation where the historical record of solid waste generation and composition can never be completed in the long term. To effectively handle these problems with only limited samples and fulfil the prediction analysis of solid waste generation with reasonable accuracy, a special analytical technique must be developed and applied before the subsequent system planning for urban solid waste management is carried out. This study presents a new theory - grey fuzzy dynamic modeling - for the prediction of solid waste generation in the urban area based on a set of limited samples. The practical implementation has been accessed by a case study in the city of Tainan in Taiwan. It shows that such a new forecasting technique may achieve better prediction accuracy than those of the conventional grey dynamic model, least-squares regression method, and the fuzzy goal regression technique.

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of normal examples with only a small percentage of abnormal or interesting examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitvity of a classier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

abstract = {Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Understanding protein subcellular localization is a necessary component toward understanding the overall function of a protein. Numerous computational methods have been published over the past decade, with varying degrees of success. Despite the large number of published methods in this area, only a small fraction of them are available for researchers to use in their own studies. Of those that are available, many are limited by predicting only a small number of major organelles in the cell. Additionally, the majority of methods predict only a single location, even though it is known that a large fraction of the proteins in eukaryotic species shuttle between locations to carry out their function. FINDINGS: We present a software package and a web server for predicting subcellular localization of protein sequences based on the ngLOC method. ngLOC is an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts subcellular localization of proteins both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The overall prediction accuracy varies from 89.8{\%} to 91.4{\%} across species. This program can predict 11 distinct locations each in plant and animal species. ngLOC also predicts 4 and 5 distinct locations on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial datasets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ngLOC is a generic method that can be trained by data from a variety of species or classes for predicting protein subcellular localization. The standalone software is freely available for academic use under GNU GPL, and the ngLOC web server is also accessible at http://ngloc.unmc.edu.},

@article{Chou2006,
abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had g25{\%} sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6{\%} and 83.7{\%}, respectively, which were 46 similar to 63{\%} higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss- Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called " Euk- OET- PLoc", has been designed at http:// 202.120.37.186/ bioinf/ euk- oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET- KNN classifier.},

abstract = {Most available antimicrobial peptides (AMP) prediction methods use common approach for different classes of AMP. Contrary to available approaches, we suggest that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact that there are several kinds of AMP that vary in mechanisms of action, structure, mode of interaction with membrane, etc. According to our suggestion for each kind of AMP, a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high efficacy. Consequently, in this paper, a particular but the biggest class of AMP, linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP), has been considered and a newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide in relation to membrane, charge density, propensities to disordered structure and aggregation were studied. On the basis of these characteristics, a new simple algorithm of prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors, hydrophobic moment, charge density and location of the peptide along the membranes, can be used as discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set, our method gives the same level of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP database service tools. For the test set accuracy obtained by our method gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools. The AMP prediction tool based on the considered method is available at http://www.biomedicine.org.ge/dbaasp/.},

abstract = {Developing an efficient method for determination of the DNA-binding proteins, due to their vital roles in gene regulation, is becoming highly desired since it would be invaluable to advance our understanding of protein functions. In this study, we proposed a new method for the prediction of the DNA-binding proteins, by performing the feature rank using random forest and the wrapper-based feature selection using forward best-first search strategy. The features comprise information from primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and position specific scoring matrix. The proposed method, called DBPPred, used Gaussian naive Bayes as the underlying classifier since it outperformed five other classifiers, including decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with polynomial kernel, and support vector machine with radial basis function. As a result, the proposed DBPPred yields the highest average accuracy of 0.791 and average MCC of 0.583 according to the five-fold cross validation with ten runs on the training benchmark dataset PDB594. Subsequently, blind tests on the independent dataset PDB186 by the proposed model trained on the entire PDB594 dataset and by other five existing methods (including iDNA-Prot, DNA-Prot, DNAbinder, DNABIND and DBD-Threader) were performed, resulting in that the proposed DBPPred yielded the highest accuracy of 0.769, MCC of 0.538, and AUC of 0.790. The independent tests performed by the proposed DBPPred on completely a large non-DNA binding protein dataset and two RNA binding protein datasets also showed improved or comparable quality when compared with the relevant prediction methods. Moreover, we observed that majority of the selected features by the proposed method are statistically significantly different between the mean feature values of the DNA-binding and the non DNA-binding proteins. All of the experimental results indicate that the proposed DBPPred can be an alternative perspective predictor for large-scale determination of DNA-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Graph embedding learning which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node representations has drawn increasing attention in recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding methods are mainly evaluated on social and information networks and have not been comprehensively studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization have shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph embedding methods (e.g., random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art. We select 11 representative graph embedding methods and conduct a systematic comparison on three important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and two node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods which have not been explored completely on biomedical tasks achieve promising results and deserve more attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Besides, compared with three state-of-the-art methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve competitive performance without using any biological features. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks. We also develop an easy-to-use Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Owing to its importance in both basic research (such as molecular evolution and protein attribute prediction) and practical application (such as timely modeling the 3D structures of proteins targeted for drug development), protein remote homology detection has attracted a great deal of interest. It is intriguing to note that the profile-based approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard. To further improve protein remote homology detection, a key step is how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary information into the profiles. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel approach, the so-called profile-based protein representation, to extract the evolutionary information via the frequency profiles. The latter can be calculated from the multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST. Three top performing sequence-based kernels (SVM-Ngram, SVM-pairwise and SVM-LA) were combined with the profile-based protein representation. Various tests were conducted on a SCOP benchmark dataset that contains 54 families and 23 superfamilies. The results showed that the new approach is promising, and can obviously improve the performance of the three kernels. Furthermore, our approach can also provide useful insights for studying the features of proteins in various families. It has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be easily combined with the existing sequence-based methods so as to improve their performance as well. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For users' convenience, the source code of generating the profile-based proteins and the multiple kernel learning was also provided at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/main/{\~{}}binliu/remote/},

Simulating protein evolution with simplified and all-atom models has shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of protein populations, the nature of evolved sequences and structures, and the extent to which today's proteins are shaped by selection pressures on folding, structure and function. Extensive mapping of the native structure, stability and folding rate in sequence space using lattice proteins has revealed organizational principles of the sequence/structure map important for evolutionary dynamics. Evolutionary simulations with lattice proteins have highlighted the importance of fitness landscapes, evolutionary mechanisms, population dynamics and sequence space entropy in shaping the generic properties of proteins. Finally, evolutionary-like simulations with all-atom models, in particular computational protein design, have helped identify the dominant selection pressures on naturally occurring protein sequences and structures.},

abstract = {In the field of statistical discrimination nearest neighbor methods are a well known, quite simple but successful nonparametric classification tool If the number of predictors increases, however, predictive power normally deteriorates. In general. if some covariates are assumed to be noise variables. variable selection is a promising approach. The paper's main focus is on the development and evaluation of a nearest neighbor ensemble with implicit variable selection. In contrast to other nearest neighbor approaches we are not primarily interested in classification, but in estimating the (posterior) class probabilities. In simulation studies and for real world data the proposed nearest neighbor ensemble is compared to an extended forward/backward variable selection procedure for nearest neighbor classifiers, and some alternative well established classification tools (that offer probability estimates as well). Despite its simple structure, the proposed method's performance is quite good - especially if relevant covariates can be separated from noise variables. Another advantage of the presented ensemble is the easy identification of interactions that are usually hard to detect. So not simply variable selection but rather some kind of feature selection is performed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved},

abstract = {The life processes of an eukaryotic cell are guided by its nucleus. In addition to the genetic material, the cellular nucleus contains many proteins located at its different compartments, called subnuclear locations. Information of their localization in a nucleus is indispensable for the in-depth study of system biology because, in addition to helping determine their functions, it can provide illuminative insights of how and in what kind of microenvironments these subnuclear proteins are interacting with each other and with other molecules. Facing the deluge of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and effectively annotating the subnuclear locations of numerous newly found nuclear protein sequences. In view of this, a new classifier, called Nuc-PLoc, has been developed that can be used to identify nuclear proteins among the following nine subnuclear locations: (1) chromatin, (2) heterochromatin, (3) nuclear envelope, (4) nuclear matrix, (5) nuclear pore complex, (6) nuclear speckle, (7) nucleolus, (8) nucleoplasm and (9) nuclear promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) body. Nuc-PLoc is featured by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing the evolution information of a protein and its pseudo-amino acid composition. The overall jackknife cross-validation accuracy obtained by Nuc-PLoc is significantly higher than those by the existing methods on the same benchmark data set through the same testing procedure. As a user-friendly web-server, Nuc-PLoc is freely accessible to the public at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Nuc-PLoc.},

abstract = {With the accomplishment of human genome sequencing, the number of sequence-known proteins has increased explosively. In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.},

Accordingly, identification of DHSs will provide useful insights for in-depth investigation into the function of noncoding genomic regions. RESULTS: In this study, using the strategy of ensemble learning framework, we proposed a new predictor called iDHS-EL for identifying the location of DHS in human genome. It was formed by fusing three individual Random Forest (RF) classifiers into an ensemble predictor. The three RF operators were respectively based on the three special modes of the general pseudo nucleotide composition (PseKNC): (i) kmer, (ii) reverse complement kmer and (iii) pseudo dinucleotide composition. It has been demonstrated that the new predictor remarkably outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and stability. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for iDHS-EL is established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iDHS-EL, which is the first web-server predictor ever established for identifying DHSs, and by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although many computational methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization, most of the methods are limited to the prediction of single-location proteins. Multi-location proteins are either not considered or assumed not existing. However, proteins with multiple locations are particularly interesting because they may have special biological functions, which are essential to both basic research and drug discovery. RESULTS: This paper proposes an efficient multi-label predictor, namely mGOASVM, for predicting the subcellular localization of multi-location proteins. Given a protein, the accession numbers of its homologs are obtained via BLAST search. Then, the original accession number and the homologous accession numbers of the protein are used as keys to search against the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation database to obtain a set of GO terms. Given a set of training proteins, a set of T relevant GO terms is obtained by finding all of the GO terms in the GO annotation database that are relevant to the training proteins. These relevant GO terms then form the basis of a T-dimensional Euclidean space on which the GO vectors lie. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a new decision scheme is proposed to classify the multi-label GO vectors. The mGOASVM predictor has the following advantages: (1) it uses the frequency of occurrences of GO terms for feature representation; (2) it selects the relevant GO subspace which can substantially speed up the prediction without compromising performance; and (3) it adopts an efficient multi-label SVM classifier which significantly outperforms other predictors. Briefly, on two recently published virus and plant datasets, mGOASVM achieves an actual accuracy of 88.9{\%} and 87.4{\%}, respectively,which are significantly higher than those achieved by the state-of-the-art predictors such as iLoc-Virus (74.8{\%}) and iLoc-Plant (68.1{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: mGOASVM can efficiently predict the subcellular locations of multi-label proteins. The mGOASVM predictor is available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/mGoaSvmServer/mGOASVM.html.},

abstract = {Proper subcellular localization is critical for proteins to perform their roles in cellular functions. Proteins are transported by different cellular sorting pathways, some of which take a protein through several intermediate locations until reaching its final destination. The pathway a protein is transported through is determined by carrier proteins that bind to specific sequence motifs. In this article, we present a new method that integrates protein interaction and sequence motif data to model how proteins are sorted through these sorting pathways. We use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to represent protein sorting pathways. The model is able to determine intermediate sorting states and to assign carrier proteins and motifs to the sorting pathways. In simulation studies, we show that the method can accurately recover an underlying sorting model. Using data for yeast, we show that our model leads to accurate prediction of subcellular localization. We also show that the pathways learned by our model recover many known sorting pathways and correctly assign proteins to the path they utilize. The learned model identified new pathways and their putative carriers and motifs and these may represent novel protein sorting mechanisms.

abstract = {Developing an efficient method for determination of the DNA-binding proteins, due to their vital roles in gene regulation, is becoming highly desired since it would be invaluable to advance our understanding of protein functions. In this study, we proposed a new method for the prediction of the DNA-binding proteins, by performing the feature rank using random forest and the wrapper-based feature selection using forward best-first search strategy. The features comprise information from primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and position specific scoring matrix. The proposed method, called DBPPred, used Gaussian naive Bayes as the underlying classifier since it outperformed five other classifiers, including decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with polynomial kernel, and support vector machine with radial basis function. As a result, the proposed DBPPred yields the highest average accuracy of 0.791 and average MCC of 0.583 according to the five-fold cross validation with ten runs on the training benchmark dataset PDB594. Subsequently, blind tests on the independent dataset PDB186 by the proposed model trained on the entire PDB594 dataset and by other five existing methods (including iDNA-Prot, DNA-Prot, DNAbinder, DNABIND and DBD-Threader) were performed, resulting in that the proposed DBPPred yielded the highest accuracy of 0.769, MCC of 0.538, and AUC of 0.790. The independent tests performed by the proposed DBPPred on completely a large non-DNA binding protein dataset and two RNA binding protein datasets also showed improved or comparable quality when compared with the relevant prediction methods. Moreover, we observed that majority of the selected features by the proposed method are statistically significantly different between the mean feature values of the DNA-binding and the non DNA-binding proteins. All of the experimental results indicate that the proposed DBPPred can be an alternative perspective predictor for large-scale determination of DNA-binding proteins.},

abstract = {We consider multi-label classification problems in application scenarios where classifier accuracy is not satisfactory, but manual annotation is too costly. In single-label problems, a well known solution consists of using a reject option, i.e., allowing a classifier to withhold unreliable decisions, leaving them (and only them) to human operators. We argue that this solution can be exploited also in multi-label problems. However, the current theoretical framework for classification with a reject option applies only to single-label problems. We thus develop a specific framework for multi-label ones. In particular, we extend multi-label accuracy measures to take into account rejections, and define manual annotation cost as a cost function. We then formalise the goal of attaining a desired trade-off between classifier accuracy on non-rejected decisions, and the cost of manually handling rejected decisions, as a constrained optimisation problem. We finally develop two possible implementations of our framework, tailored to the widely used F accuracy measure, and to the only cost models proposed so far for multi-label annotation tasks, and experimentally evaluate them on five application domains.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Subcellular localization is a key feature in the process of functional annotation of both globular and membrane proteins. In the absence of experimental data, protein localization is inferred on the basis of annotation transfer upon sequence similarity search. However, predictive tools are necessary when the localization of homologs is not known. This is so particularly for membrane proteins. Furthermore, most of the available predictors of subcellular localization are specifically trained on globular proteins and poorly perform on membrane proteins. RESULTS: Here we develop MemLoci, a new support vector machine-based tool that discriminates three membrane protein localizations: plasma, internal and organelle membrane. When tested on an independent set, MemLoci outperforms existing methods, reaching an overall accuracy of 70{\%} on predicting the location in the three membrane types, with a generalized correlation coefficient as high as 0.50.

abstract = {Kernel-based learning algorithms work by embedding the data into a Euclidean space, and then searching for linear relations among the embedded data points. The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space-classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm- using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.},

abstract = {Protein subcellular localization aims at predicting the location of a protein within a cell using computational methods. Knowledge of subcellular localization of viral proteins in a host cell or virus-infected cell is important because it is closely related to their destructive tendencies and consequences. Prediction of viral protein subcellular localization is an important but challenging problem, particularly when proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing protein subcellular localization methods specialized for viral proteins are only used to deal with the single-location proteins. To better reflect the characteristics of multiplex proteins, a new predictor, called Virus-ECC-mPLoc, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both singleplex and multiplex proteins by introducing a powerful multi-label learning approach which exploits correlations between subcellular locations and by hybridizing the gene ontology information with the dipeptide composition information. It can be utilized to identify viral proteins among the following six locations: (1) viral capsid, (2) host cell membrane, (3) host endoplasmic reticulum, (4) host cytoplasm, (5) host nucleus, and (6) secreted. Experimental results show that the overall success rates thus obtained by Virus-ECC-mPLoc are 86.9{\%} for jackknife test and 87.2{\%} for independent data set test, which are significantly higher than that by any of the existing predictors. As a user-friendly web-server, Virus-ECCmPLoc is freely accessible to the public at the web-site http://levis.tongji.edu.cn:8080/bioinfo/Virus-ECC-mPLoc/.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA repair is the general term for the collection of critical mechanisms which repair many forms of DNA damage such as methylation or ionizing radiation. DNA repair has mainly been studied in experimental and clinical situations, and relatively few information-based approaches to new extracting DNA repair knowledge exist. As a first step, automatic detection of DNA repair proteins in genomes via informatics techniques is desirable; however, there are many forms of DNA repair and it is not a straightforward process to identify and classify repair proteins with a single optimal method. We perform a study of the ability of homology and machine learning-based methods to identify and classify DNA repair proteins, as well as scan vertebrate genomes for the presence of novel repair proteins. Combinations of primary sequence polypeptide frequency, secondary structure, and homology information are used as feature information for input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM). RESULTS: We identify that SVM techniques are capable of identifying portions of DNA repair protein datasets without admitting false positives; at low levels of false positive tolerance, homology can also identify and classify proteins with good performance. Secondary structure information provides improved performance compared to using primary structure alone. Furthermore, we observe that machine learning methods incorporating homology information perform best when data is filtered by some clustering technique. Analysis by applying these methodologies to the scanning of multiple vertebrate genomes confirms a positive correlation between the size of a genome and the number of DNA repair protein transcripts it is likely to contain, and simultaneously suggests that all organisms have a non-zero minimum number of repair genes. In addition, the scan result clusters several organisms' repair abilities in an evolutionarily consistent fashion. Analysis also identifies several functionally unconfirmed proteins that are highly likely to be involved in the repair process. A new web service, INTREPED, has been made available for the immediate search and annotation of DNA repair proteins in newly sequenced genomes. CONCLUSION: Despite complexity due to a multitude of repair pathways, combinations of sequence, structure, and homology with Support Vector Machines offer good methods in addition to existing homology searches for DNA repair protein identification and functional annotation. Most importantly, this study has uncovered relationships between the size of a genome and a genome's available repair repertoire, and offers a number of new predictions as well as a prediction service, both which reduce the search time and cost for novel repair genes and proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although primarily known as the site of ribosome subunit production, the nucleolus is involved in numerous and diverse cellular processes. Recent large-scale proteomics projects have identified thousands of human proteins that associate with the nucleolus. However, in most cases, we know neither the fraction of each protein pool that is nucleolus-associated nor whether their association is permanent or conditional. RESULTS: To describe the dynamic localisation of proteins in the nucleolus, we investigated the extent of nucleolar association of proteins by first collating an extensively curated literature-derived dataset. This dataset then served to train a probabilistic predictor which integrates gene and protein characteristics. Unlike most previous experimental and computational studies of the nucleolar proteome that produce large static lists of nucleolar proteins regardless of their extent of nucleolar association, our predictor models the fluidity of the nucleolus by considering different classes of nucleolar-associated proteins. The new method predicts all human proteins as either nucleolar-enriched, nucleolar-nucleoplasmic, nucleolar-cytoplasmic or non-nucleolar. Leave-one-out cross validation tests reveal sensitivity values for these four classes ranging from 0.72 to 0.90 and positive predictive values ranging from 0.63 to 0.94. The overall accuracy of the classifier was measured to be 0.85 on an independent literature-based test set and 0.74 using a large independent quantitative proteomics dataset. While the three nucleolar-association groups display vastly different Gene Ontology biological process signatures and evolutionary characteristics, they collectively represent the most well characterised nucleolar functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our proteome-wide classification of nucleolar association provides a novel representation of the dynamic content of the nucleolus. This model of nucleolar localisation thus increases the coverage while providing accurate and specific annotations of the nucleolar proteome. It will be instrumental in better understanding the central role of the nucleolus in the cell and its interaction with other subcellular compartments.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes are replete with millions of polymorphic sites, among which those genetic variants that are co-located on the same chromosome and exist close to one another form blocks of closely linked mutations known as haplotypes. The linkage within haplotypes is constantly disrupted due to meiotic recombination events. Whole ensembles of such numerous haplotypes are subjected to evolutionary pressure, where mutations influence each other and should be considered as a whole entity - a gigantic matrix, unique for each individual genome. This idea was implemented into a computational approach, named Genome Evolution by Matrix Algorithms (GEMA) to model genomic changes taking into account all mutations in a population. GEMA has been tested for modeling of entire human chromosomes. The program can precisely mimic real biological processes that have influence on genome evolution such as: 1) authentic arrangements of genes and functional genomic elements; 2) frequencies of various types of mutations in different nucleotide contexts; 3) non-random distribution of meiotic recombination events along chromosomes. Computer modeling with GEMA has demonstrated that the number of meiotic recombination events per gamete is among the most crucial factors influencing population fitness. In humans, these recombinations create a gamete genome consisting on an average of 48 pieces of corresponding parental chromosomes. Such highly mosaic gamete structure allows preserving fitness of population under the intense influx of novel mutations (40 per individual) even when the number of mutations with deleterious effects is up to ten times more abundant than those with beneficial effects.},

Computational prediction of protein structures is a research field in which high confidence three-dimensional protein models can be proposed based on the sequence alignment between target and templates. However, to date, only a few approaches have been developed for the computational prediction of RNA structures. Similar to proteins, RNA structures may be altered due to the interaction with various ligands, including proteins, other RNAs, and metabolites. A riboswitch is a molecular mechanism, found in the three kingdoms of life, in which the RNA structure is modified by the binding of a metabolite. It can regulate multiple gene expression mechanisms, such as transcription, translation initiation, and mRNA splicing and processing. Due to their nature, these entities also act on the regulation of gene expression and detection of small metabolites and have the potential to helping in the discovery of new classes of antimicrobial agents. In this review, we describe software and web servers currently available for riboswitch aptamer identification and secondary and tertiary structure prediction, including applications.},

abstract = {Subcellular localization is one of the key functional characteristics of proteins. An automatic and efficient prediction method for the protein subcellular localization is highly required owing to the need for large-scale genome analysis. From a machine learning point of view, a dataset of protein localization has several characteristics: the dataset has too many classes (there are more than 10 localizations in a cell), it is a multi-label dataset (a protein may occur in several different subcellular locations), and it is too imbalanced (the number of proteins in each localization is remarkably different). Even though many previous works have been done for the prediction of protein subcellular localization, none of them tackles effectively these characteristics at the same time. Thus, a new computational method for protein localization is eventually needed for more reliable outcomes. To address the issue, we present a protein localization predictor based on D-SVDD (PLPD) for the prediction of protein localization, which can find the likelihood of a specific localization of a protein more easily and more correctly. Moreover, we introduce three measurements for the more precise evaluation of a protein localization predictor. As the results of various datasets which are made from the experiments of Huh et al. (2003), the proposed PLPD method represents a different approach that might play a complimentary role to the existing methods, such as Nearest Neighbor method and discriminate covariant method. Finally, after finding a good boundary for each localization using the 5184 classified proteins as training data, we predicted 138 proteins whose subcellular localizations could not be clearly observed by the experiments of Huh et al. (2003).},

abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in determining cellular behavior by manipulating the processing of target RNAs. Robust methods are required to detect the numerous binding sites of RBPs across the transcriptome. RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) and crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) are state-of-the-art methods used to identify the RNA targets and specific binding sites of RBPs. Historically, CLIP methods have been confounded with challenges such as the requirement for tens of millions of cells per experiment, low RNA yields resulting in libraries that contain a high number of polymerase chain reaction duplicated reads, and technical inconveniences such as radioactive labeling of RNAs. However, recent improvements in the recovery of bound RNAs and the efficiency of converting isolated RNAs into a library for sequencing have enhanced our ability to perform the experiment at scale, from less starting material than has previously been possible, and resulting in high quality datasets for the confident identification of protein binding sites. These, along with additional improvements to protein capture, removal of nonspecific signals, and methods to isolate noncanonical RBP targets have revolutionized the study of RNA processing regulation, and reveal a promising future for mapping the human protein-RNA regulatory network.

abstract = {Subcellular locations of proteins are important functional attributes. An effective and efficient subcellular localization predictor is necessary for rapidly and reliably annotating subcellular locations of proteins. Most of existing subcellular localization methods are only used to deal with single-location proteins. Actually, proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. To better reflect characteristics of multiplex proteins, it is highly desired to develop new methods for dealing with them. In this paper, a new predictor, called Euk-ECC-mPLoc, by introducing a powerful multi-label learning approach which exploits correlations between subcellular locations and hybridizing gene ontology with dipeptide composition information, has been developed that can be used to deal with systems containing both singleplex and multiplex eukaryotic proteins. It can be utilized to identify eukaryotic proteins among the following 22 locations: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) cell wall, (4) centrosome, (5) chloroplast, (6) cyanelle, (7) cytoplasm, (8) cytoskeleton, (9) endoplasmic reticulum, (10) endosome, (11) extracellular, (12) Golgi apparatus, (13) hydrogenosome, (14) lysosome, (15) melanosome, (16) microsome, (17) mitochondrion, (18) nucleus, (19) peroxisome, (20) spindle pole body, (21) synapse, and (22) vacuole. Experimental results on a stringent benchmark dataset of eukaryotic proteins by jackknife cross validation test show that the average success rate and overall success rate obtained by Euk-ECC-mPLoc were 69.70{\%} and 81.54{\%}, respectively, indicating that our approach is quite promising. Particularly, the success rates achieved by Euk-ECC-mPLoc for small subsets were remarkably improved, indicating that it holds a high potential for simulating the development of the area. As a user-friendly web-server, Euk-ECC-mPLoc is freely accessible to the public at the website http://levis.tongji.edu.cn:8080/bioinfo/Euk-ECC-mPLoc/. We believe that Euk-ECC-mPLoc may become a useful high-throughput tool, or at least play a complementary role to the existing predictors in identifying subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed much progress in computational modelling for protein subcellular localization. However, the existing sequence-based predictive models demonstrate moderate or unsatisfactory performance, and the gene ontology (GO) based models may take the risk of performance overestimation for novel proteins. Furthermore, many human proteins have multiple subcellular locations, which renders the computational modelling more complicated. Up to the present, there are far few researches specialized for predicting the subcellular localization of human proteins that may reside in multiple cellular compartments. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for human protein subcellular localization (MLMK-TLM). MLMK-TLM proposes a multi-label confusion matrix, formally formulates three multi-labelling performance measures and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which to further extends our published work GO-TLM (gene ontology based transfer learning model for protein subcellular localization) and MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for multiplex human protein subcellular localization. With the advantages of proper homolog knowledge transfer, comprehensive survey of model performance for novel protein and multi-labelling capability, MLMK-TLM will gain more practical applicability. The experiments on human protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM significantly outperforms the baseline model and demonstrates good multi-labelling ability for novel human proteins. Some findings (predictions) are validated by the latest Swiss-Prot database. The software can be freely downloaded at http://soft.synu.edu.cn/upload/msy.rar.},

We use deep convolutional networks to emulate the primate's ventral visual stream and explore the recent finding that baboons can be trained to discriminate English words from nonwords [1]. The networks were exposed to the exact same sequence of stimuli and reinforcement signals as the baboons in the experiment, and learned to map real visual inputs (pixels) of letter strings onto binary word/nonword responses. We show that the networks' highest levels of representations were indeed sensitive to letter combinations as postulated in our previous research. The model also captured the key empirical findings, such as generalization to novel words, along with some intriguing inter-individual differences. The present work shows the merits of deep learning networks that can simulate the whole processing chain all the way from the visual input to the response while allowing researchers to analyze the complex representations that emerge during the learning process.},

abstract = {Relational data has two characteristics: first, statistical dependencies exist between the entities we wish to model, and second, each entity often has a rich set of features that can aid classification. For example, when classifying Web documents, the pages text provides much information about the class label, but hyperlinks define a relationship between pages that can improve classification Taskar et al., 2002. Graphical models are a natural formalism for exploiting the dependence structure among entities. Traditionally, graphical models have been used to represent the joint probability distribution p(y, x), where the variables y represent the attributes of the entities that we wish to predict, and the input variables x represent our observed knowledge about the entities. But modeling the joint distribution can lead to difficulties when using the rich local features that can occur in relational data, because it requires modeling the distribution p(x), which can include complex dependencies. Modeling these dependencies among inputs can lead to intractable models, but ignoring them can lead to reduced performance. A solution to this problem is to directly model the conditional distribution p(yx), which is sufficient for classification. This is the approach taken by conditional random fields Lafferty et al., 2001. A conditional random field is simply a conditional distribution p(yx) with an associated graphical structure. Because the model is conditional, dependencies among the input variables x do not need to be explicitly represented, affording the use of rich, global features of the input. For example, in natural language tasks, useful features include neighboring words and word bigrams, prefixes and suffixes, capitalization, membership in domain-specific lexicons, and semantic information from sources such as WordNet. Recently there has been an explosion of interest in CRFs, with successful applications including text processing Taskar et al., 2002, Peng and McCallum, 2004, Settles, 2005, Sha and Pereira, 2003, bioinformatics Sato and Sakakibara, 2005, Liu et al., 2005, and computer vision He et al., 2004, Kumar and Hebert, 2003. This chapter is divided into two parts. First, we present a tutorial on current training and inference techniques for conditional random fields. We discuss the important special case of linear-chain CRFs, and then we generalize these to arbitrary graphical structures. We include a brief discussion of techniques for practical CRF implementations. Second, we present an example of applying a general CRF to a practical relational learning problem. In particular, we discuss the problem of information extraction, that is, automatically building a relational database from information contained in unstructured text. Unlike linear-chain models, general CRFs can capture long distance dependencies between labels. For example, if the same name is mentioned more than once in a document, all mentions probably have the same label, and it is useful to extract them all, because each mention may contain different complementary information about the underlying entity. To represent these long-distance dependencies, we propose a skip-chain CRF, a model that jointly performs segmentation and collective labeling of extracted mentions. On a standard problem of extracting speaker names from seminar announcements, the skip-chain CRF has better performance than a linear-chain CRF.},

Despite major efforts to develop accurate enhancer prediction methods, identifying enhancer sequences continues to be a challenge in the annotation of mammalian genomes. One of the major issues is the lack of large, sufficiently comprehensive and experimentally validated enhancers for humans or other species. Thus, the development of computational methods based on limited experimentally validated enhancers and deciphering the transcriptional regulatory code encoded in the enhancer sequences is urgent. Results We present a deep-learning-based hybrid architecture, BiRen, which predicts enhancers using the DNA sequence alone. Our results demonstrate that BiRen can learn common enhancer patterns directly from the DNA sequence and exhibits superior accuracy, robustness and generalizability in enhancer prediction relative to other state-of-the-art enhancer predictors based on sequence characteristics. Our BiRen will enable researchers to acquire a deeper understanding of the regulatory code of enhancer sequences.

abstract = {Frog skin constitutes a rich source of peptides with a wide range of biological properties. These include host-defense peptides with cytotoxic activities against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and mammalian cells. Several hundred such peptides from diverse species have been described. Although attention has been focused mainly on antimicrobial activity, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents remains to be realized and no compound based upon their structures has yet been adopted in clinical practice. Consequently, alternative applications are being explored. Certain naturally occurring frog skin peptides, and analogs with improved therapeutic properties, show selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells and viruses and so have potential for development into anti-cancer and anti-viral agents. Some peptides display complex cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties. Effects on the production of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines by peritoneal macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been observed so that clinical applications as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory agents are possible. Several frog skin peptides, first identified on the basis of antimicrobial activity, have been shown to stimulate insulin release both in vitro and in vivo and so show potential as incretin-based therapies for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review assesses the therapeutic possibilities of peptides from frogs belonging to the Ascaphidae, Alytidae, Pipidae, Dicroglossidae, Leptodactylidae, Hylidae, and Ranidae families that complement their potential role as anti-infectives for use against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.},

abstract = {Motivation: Revealing the subcellular localization of proteins within membrane-bound compartments is of a major importance for inferring protein function. Though current high-throughput localization experiments provide valuable data, they are costly and time-consuming, and due to technical difficulties not readily applicable for many Eukaryotes. Physical characteristics of proteins, such as sequence targeting signals and amino acid composition are commonly used to predict subcellular localizations using computational approaches. Recently it was shown that protein protein interaction (PPI) networks can be used to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of protein subcellular localization. However, as high-throughput PPI data depend on costly high-throughput experiments and are currently available for only a few organisms, the scope of such methods is yet limited. Results: This study presents a novel constraint-based method for predicting subcellular localization of enzymes based on their embedding metabolic network, relying on a parsimony principle of a minimal number of cross-membrane metabolite transporters. In a cross-validation test of predicting known subcellular localization of yeast enzymes, the method is shown to be markedly robust, providing accurate localization predictions even when only 20{\%} of the known enzyme localizations are given as input. It is shown to outperform pathway enrichment-based methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and in its ability to predict the subcellular localization of entire metabolic pathways when no a-priori pathway-specific localization data is available (and hence enrichment methods are bound to fail). With the number of available metabolic networks already reaching more than 600 and growing fast, the new method may significantly contribute to the identification of enzyme localizations in many different organisms.},

abstract = {Protein subcellular localization is concerned with predicting the location of a protein within a cell using computational methods. The location information can indicate key functionalities of proteins. Thus, accurate prediction of subcellular localizations of proteins can help the prediction of protein functions and genome annotations, as well as the identification of drug targets. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been used in the past for the problem of protein subcellular localization, but have been shown to suffer from a lack of annotated training data in each species under study. To overcome this data sparsity problem, we observe that because some of the organisms may be related to each other, there may be some commonalities across different organisms that can be discovered and used to help boost the data in each localization task. In this paper, we formulate protein subcellular localization problem as one of multitask learning across different organisms. We adapt and compare two specializations of the multitask learning algorithms on 20 different organisms. Our experimental results show that multitask learning performs much better than the traditional single-task methods. Among the different multitask learning methods, we found that the multitask kernels and supertype kernels under multitask learning that share parameters perform slightly better than multitask learning by sharing latent features. The most significant improvement in terms of localization accuracy is about 25 percent. We find that if the organisms are very different or are remotely related from a biological point of view, then jointly training the multiple models cannot lead to significant improvement. However, if they are closely related biologically, the multitask learning can do much better than individual learning.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of genomic and molecular information is the basis for understanding higher-order biological systems, such as the cell and the organism, and their interactions with the environment, as well as for medical, industrial and other practical applications. The KEGG resource (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to biological systems, categorized as building blocks in the genomic space (KEGG GENES) and the chemical space (KEGG LIGAND), and wiring diagrams of interaction networks and reaction networks (KEGG PATHWAY). A fourth component, KEGG BRITE, has been formally added to the KEGG suite of databases. This reflects our attempt to computerize functional interpretations as part of the pathway reconstruction process based on the hierarchically structured knowledge about the genomic, chemical and network spaces. In accordance with the new chemical genomics initiatives, the scope of KEGG LIGAND has been significantly expanded to cover both endogenous and exogenous molecules. Specifically, RPAIR contains curated chemical structure transformation patterns extracted from known enzymatic reactions, which would enable analysis of genome-environment interactions, such as the prediction of new reactions and new enzyme genes that would degrade new environmental compounds. Additionally, drug information is now stored separately and linked to new KEGG DRUG structure maps.},

abstract = {Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was developed as a method for detecting statistical patterns of epistasis. The overall goal of MDR is to change the representation space of the data to make interactions easier to detect. It is well known that machine learning methods may not provide robust models when the class variable (e.g. case-control status) is imbalanced and accuracy is used as the fitness measure. This is because most methods learn patterns that are relevant for the larger of the two classes. The goal of this study was to evaluate three different strategies for improving the power of MDR to detect epistasis in imbalanced datasets. The methods evaluated were: (1) over-sampling that resamples with replacement the smaller class until the data are balanced, (2) under-sampling that randomly removes subjects from the larger class until the data are balanced, and (3) balanced accuracy [(sensitivity+specificity)/2] as the fitness function with and without an adjusted threshold. These three methods were compared using simulated data with two-locus epistatic interactions of varying heritability (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and minor allele frequency (0.2, 0.4) that were embedded in 100 replicate datasets of varying sample sizes (400, 800, 1600). Each dataset was generated with different ratios of cases to controls (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4). We found that the balanced accuracy function with an adjusted threshold significantly outperformed both over-sampling and under-sampling and fully recovered the power. These results suggest that balanced accuracy should be used instead of accuracy for the MDR analysis of epistasis in imbalanced datasets.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Increasing antibiotics resistance in human pathogens represents a pressing public health issue worldwide for which novel antibiotic therapies based on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may offer one possible solution. In the current study, we utilized publicly available data on AMPs to construct hidden Markov models (HMMs) that enable recognition of individual classes of antimicrobials peptides (such as defensins, cathelicidins, cecropins, etc.) with up to 99{\%} accuracy and can be used for discovering novel AMP candidates. RESULTS: HMM models for both mature peptides and propeptides were constructed. A total of 146 models for mature peptides and 40 for propeptides have been developed for individual AMP classes. These were created by clustering and analyzing AMP sequences available in the public sources and by consequent iterative scanning of the Swiss-Prot database for previously unknown gene-coded AMPs. As a result, an additional 229 additional AMPs have been identified from Swiss-Prot, and all but 34 could be associated with known antimicrobial activities according to the literature. The final set of 1045 mature peptides and 253 propeptides have been organized into the open-source AMPer database. AVAILABILITY: The developed HMM-based tools and AMP sequences can be accessed through the AMPer resource at http://www.cnbi2.com/cgi-bin/amp.pl},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular locations has attracted much attention in the past decade. However, one of the most challenging problems is that many proteins were found simultaneously existing in, or moving between, two or more different cell components in a eukaryotic cell. Seldom previous predictors were able to deal with such multiplex proteins although they have extremely important implications in future drug discovery in terms of their specific subcellular targeting. Approximately 20{\%} of the human proteome consists of such multiplex proteins with multiple sample labels. In order to efficiently handle such multiplex human proteins, we have developed a novel multi-label (ML) learning and prediction framework called ML-PLoc, which decomposes the multi-label prediction problem into multiple independent binary classification problems. ML-PLoc is constructed based on support vector machine (SVM) and sequential evolution information. Experimental results show that ML-PLoc can achieve an overall accuracy 64.6{\%} and recall ratio 67.2{\%} on a benchmark dataset consisting of 14 human subcellular locations, and is very powerful for dealing with multiplex proteins. The current approach represents a new strategy to deal with the multi-label biological problems. ML-PLoc software is freely available for academic use at: http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/ML-PLoc.},

abstract = {Protein remote homology detection is one of the important tasks in computational proteomics, which is important for basic research and practical application. Currently, the SVM-based discriminative methods have shown superior performance. However, the existing feature vectors still cannot suitably represent the protein sequences, and often lack an interpretable model for analysis of characteristic features. Previous studies showed that sequence-order effects and physicochemical properties are important for representing protein sequences. However, how to use these kinds of information for constructing predictors is still a challenging problem. In this study, in order to incorporate the sequence-order information and physicochemical properties into the prediction, a method called disPseAAC is proposed, in which the feature vector is constructed by combining the occurrences of amino acid pairs within the Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) approach. The predictive performance and computational cost are further improved by employing the principal component analysis strategy. Various experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that disPseAAC achieves an ROC score of 0.922, outperforming some existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the learnt model can easily be analyzed in terms of discriminative features, and the computational cost of the proposed method is much lower than that of other profile-based methods.},

abstract = {The recently proposed Temporal Ensembling has achieved state-of-the-art results in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. It maintains an exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However, because the targets change only once per epoch, Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose Mean Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35{\%} on SVHN with 250 labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance. Combining Mean Teacher and Residual Networks, we improve the state of the art on CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels from 10.55{\%} to 6.28{\%}, and on ImageNet 2012 with 10{\%} of the labels from 35.24{\%} to 9.11{\%}.},

@article{Scott2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although primarily known as the site of ribosome subunit production, the nucleolus is involved in numerous and diverse cellular processes. Recent large-scale proteomics projects have identified thousands of human proteins that associate with the nucleolus. However, in most cases, we know neither the fraction of each protein pool that is nucleolus-associated nor whether their association is permanent or conditional. RESULTS: To describe the dynamic localisation of proteins in the nucleolus, we investigated the extent of nucleolar association of proteins by first collating an extensively curated literature-derived dataset. This dataset then served to train a probabilistic predictor which integrates gene and protein characteristics. Unlike most previous experimental and computational studies of the nucleolar proteome that produce large static lists of nucleolar proteins regardless of their extent of nucleolar association, our predictor models the fluidity of the nucleolus by considering different classes of nucleolar-associated proteins. The new method predicts all human proteins as either nucleolar-enriched, nucleolar-nucleoplasmic, nucleolar-cytoplasmic or non-nucleolar. Leave-one-out cross validation tests reveal sensitivity values for these four classes ranging from 0.72 to 0.90 and positive predictive values ranging from 0.63 to 0.94. The overall accuracy of the classifier was measured to be 0.85 on an independent literature-based test set and 0.74 using a large independent quantitative proteomics dataset. While the three nucleolar-association groups display vastly different Gene Ontology biological process signatures and evolutionary characteristics, they collectively represent the most well characterised nucleolar functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our proteome-wide classification of nucleolar association provides a novel representation of the dynamic content of the nucleolus. This model of nucleolar localisation thus increases the coverage while providing accurate and specific annotations of the nucleolar proteome. It will be instrumental in better understanding the central role of the nucleolus in the cell and its interaction with other subcellular compartments.},

abstract = {As the key components of innate immunity, human host defense antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) play a critical role in warding off invading microbial pathogens. In addition, AMPs can possess other biological functions such as apoptosis, wound healing, and immune modulation. This article provides an overview on the identification, activity, 3D structure, and mechanism of action of human AMPs selected from the antimicrobial peptide database. Over 100 such peptides have been identified from a variety of tissues and epithelial surfaces, including skin, eyes, ears, mouths, gut, immune, nervous and urinary systems. These peptides vary from 10 to 150 amino acids with a net charge between -3 and +20 and a hydrophobic content below 60{\%}. The sequence diversity enables human AMPs to adopt various 3D structures and to attack pathogens by different mechanisms. While alpha-defensin HD-6 can self-assemble on the bacterial surface into nanonets to entangle bacteria, both HNP-1 and beta-defensin hBD-3 are able to block cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II. Lysozyme is well-characterized to cleave bacterial cell wall polysaccharides but can also kill bacteria by a non-catalytic mechanism. The two hydrophobic domains in the long amphipathic alpha-helix of human cathelicidin LL-37 lays the basis for binding and disrupting the curved anionic bacterial membrane surfaces by forming pores or via the carpet model. Furthermore, dermcidin may serve as ion channel by forming a long helix-bundle structure. In addition, the C-type lectin RegIIIalpha can initially recognize bacterial peptidoglycans followed by pore formation in the membrane. Finally, histatin 5 and GAPDH(2-32) can enter microbial cells to exert their effects. It appears that granulysin enters cells and kills intracellular pathogens with the aid of pore-forming perforin. This arsenal of human defense proteins not only keeps us healthy but also inspires the development of a new generation of personalized medicine to combat drug-resistant superbugs, fungi, viruses, parasites, or cancer. Alternatively, multiple factors (e.g., albumin, arginine, butyrate, calcium, cyclic AMP, isoleucine, short-chain fatty acids, UV B light, vitamin D, and zinc) are able to induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides, opening new avenues to the development of anti-infectious drugs.},

abstract = {Background: The functions of proteins are closely related to their subcellular locations. In the post-genomics era, the amount of gene and protein data grows exponentially, which necessitates the prediction of subcellular localization by computational means. Results: This paper proposes mitigating the computation burden of alignment-based approaches to subcellular localization prediction by a cascaded fusion of cleavage site prediction and profile alignment. Specifically, the informative segments of protein sequences are identified by a cleavage site predictor using the information in their N-terminal shorting signals. Then, the sequences are truncated at the cleavage site positions, and the shortened sequences are passed to PSI-BLAST for computing their profiles. Subcellular localization are subsequently predicted by a profile-to-profile alignment support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier. To further reduce the training and recognition time of the classifier, the SVM classifier is replaced by a new kernel method based on the perturbational discriminant analysis (PDA). Conclusions: Experimental results on a new dataset based on Swiss-Prot Release 57.5 show that the method can make use of the best property of signal-and homology-based approaches and can attain an accuracy comparable to that achieved by using full-length sequences. Analysis of profile-alignment score matrices suggest that both profile creation time and profile alignment time can be reduced without significant reduction in subcellular localization accuracy. It was found that PDA enjoys a short training time as compared to the conventional SVM. We advocate that the method will be important for biologists to conduct large-scale protein annotation or for bioinformaticians to perform preliminary investigations on new algorithms that involve pairwise alignments.},

abstract = {Learning from imbalanced data is a problem which arises in many real-world scenarios, so does the need to build classifiers able to predict more than one class label simultaneously (multilabel classification). Dealing with imbalance by means of resampling methods is an approach that has been deeply studied lately, primarily in the context of traditional (non-multilabel) classification. In this paper the process of synthetic instance generation for multilabel datasets (MLDs) is studied and MLSMOTE (Multilabel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a new algorithm aimed to produce synthetic instances for imbalanced MLDs, is proposed. An extensive review on how imbalance in the multilabel context has been tackled in the past is provided, along with a thorough experimental study aimed to verify the benefits of the proposed algorithm. Several multilabel classification algorithms and other multilabel oversampling methods are considered, as well as ensemble-based algorithms for imbalanced multilabel classification. The empirical analysis shows that MLSMOTE is able to improve the classification results produced by existent proposals.},

abstract = {Delineating the determinants of folding of small proteins is essential for decoding the folding code. By considering the literature data for the folding of 45 two-state proteins that differ widely in sequence, structure, and function, this work suggests two empirical relations for the prediction of the folding rate. One relation is based on the content of secondary structure elements, and the other uses the number of residues of each of the following types: hydrophobic, positively charged, and negatively charged. Both relations incorporate the chain length as an indirect descriptor. The correlation between experimental values for folding rates and free energy is poor, providing little support to the "stability gap" hypothesis based on the folding of simple lattice and off-lattice polymers. The average rate-determining barrier height for these two-state proteins is much larger than the small barriers for the transition-state ensemble envisaged by theoretical models.},

abstract = {Protein sequence evolution has resulted in a vast repertoire of molecular functionality crucial to life. Despite the central importance of sequence evolution to biology, our fundamental understanding of how sequence composition affects evolution is incomplete. This report describes the utilization of lattice model simulations of directed evolution, which indicate that, on average, peptide and protein evolvability is strongly dependent on initial sequence composition. The report also discusses two distinct regimes of sequence evolution by point mutation: (a) the "classical" mode where sequences "crawl" over free energy barriers towards acquiring a target fold, and (b) the "quantum" mode where sequences appear to "tunnel" through large energy barriers generally insurmountable by means of a crawl. Finally, the simulations indicate that oily and charged peptides are the most efficient substrates for evolution at the "classical" and "quantum" regimes, respectively, and that their respective response to temperature is commensurate with analogies made to barrier crossing in classical and quantum systems. On the whole, these results show that sequence composition can tune both the evolvability and the optimal mode of evolution of peptides and proteins.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in the post-transcriptional control of RNAs. Identifying RBP binding sites and characterizing RBP binding preferences are key steps toward understanding the basic mechanisms of the post-transcriptional gene regulation. Though numerous computational methods have been developed for modeling RBP binding preferences, discovering a complete structural representation of the RBP targets by integrating their available structural features in all three dimensions is still a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a general and flexible deep learning framework for modeling structural binding preferences and predicting binding sites of RBPs, which takes (predicted) RNA tertiary structural information into account for the first time. Our framework constructs a unified representation that characterizes the structural specificities of RBP targets in all three dimensions, which can be further used to predict novel candidate binding sites and discover potential binding motifs. Through testing on the real CLIP-seq datasets, we have demonstrated that our deep learning framework can automatically extract effective hidden structural features from the encoded raw sequence and structural profiles, and predict accurate RBP binding sites. In addition, we have conducted the first study to show that integrating the additional RNA tertiary structural features can improve the model performance in predicting RBP binding sites, especially for the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which also provides a new evidence to support the view that RBPs may own specific tertiary structural binding preferences. In particular, the tests on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) segments yield satisfiable results with experimental support from the literature and further demonstrate the necessity of incorporating RNA tertiary structural information into the prediction model. The source code of our approach can be found in https://github.com/thucombio/deepnet-rbp.},

In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce a wide variety of extracellular signals to within the cell and therefore have a key role in regulating cell activity and physiological function. GPCR malfunction is responsible for a wide range of diseases including cancer, diabetes and hyperthyroidism and a large proportion of drugs on the market target these receptors. The three dimensional structure of GPCRs is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and for performing structure-based drug design. Although structural data are restricted to only a handful of GPCRs, homology models can be used as a proxy for those receptors not having crystal structures. However, many researchers working on GPCRs are not experienced homology modellers and are therefore unable to benefit from the information that can be gleaned from such three-dimensional models. Here, we present a comprehensive database called the GPCR-SSFE, which provides initial homology models of the transmembrane helices for a large variety of family A GPCRs. DESCRIPTION: Extending on our previous theoretical work, we have developed an automated pipeline for GPCR homology modelling and applied it to a large set of family A GPCR sequences. Our pipeline is a fragment-based approach that exploits available family A crystal structures. The GPCR-SSFE database stores the template predictions, sequence alignments, identified sequence and structure motifs and homology models for 5025 family A GPCRs. Users are able to browse the GPCR dataset according to their pharmacological classification or search for results using a UniProt entry name. It is also possible for a user to submit a GPCR sequence that is not contained in the database for analysis and homology model building. The models can be viewed using a Jmol applet and are also available for download along with the alignments. CONCLUSIONS: The data provided by GPCR-SSFE are useful for investigating general and detailed sequence-structure-function relationships of GPCRs, performing structure-based drug design and for better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-associated mutations in GPCRs. The effectiveness of our multiple template and fragment approach is demonstrated by the accuracy of our predicted homology models compared to recently published crystal structures.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework called Localized Support Vector Machine (LSVM) for classifying data with nonlinear decision surfaces. Instead of building a sophisticated global model from the training data, LSVM constructs multiple linear SVMs, each of which is designed to accurately classify a given test example. A major limitation of this framework is its high computational cost since a unique model must be constructed for each test example. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient implementation of LSVM, termed Profile SVM (PSVM). PSVM partitions the training examples into clusters and builds a separate linear SVM model for each cluster. Our empirical results show that 1) LSVM and PSVM outperform nonlinear SVM for all 20 of the evaluated data sets and 2) PSVM achieves comparable performance as LSVM in terms of model accuracy but with significant computational savings. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in terms of classifying data with spatial and temporal dependencies.},

abstract = {The prevailing views as to the form, function, and regulation of genomic methylation patterns have their origin many years in the past, at a time when the structure of the mammalian genome was only dimly perceived, when the number of protein-encoding mammalian genes was believed to be at least five times greater than the actual number, and when it was not understood that only {\~{}}10{\%} of the genome is under selective pressure and likely to have biological function. We use more recent findings from genome biology and whole-genome methylation profiling to provide a reappraisal of the shape of genomic methylation patterns and the nature of the changes that they undergo during gametogenesis and early development. We observe that the sequences that undergo deep changes in methylation status during early development are largely sequences without regulatory function. We also discuss recent findings that begin to explain the remarkable fidelity of maintenance methylation. Rather than a general overview of DNA methylation in mammals (which has been the subject of many reviews), we present a new analysis of the distribution of methylated CpG dinucleotides across the multiple sequence compartments that make up the mammalian genome, and we offer an updated interpretation of the nature of the changes in methylation patterns that occur in germ cells and early embryos. We discuss the cues that might designate specific sequences for demethylation or de novo methylation during development, and we summarize recent findings on mechanisms that maintain methylation patterns in mammalian genomes. We also describe the several human disorders, each very different from the other, that are caused by mutations in DNA methyltransferase genes.},

abstract = {Tracking historical levels as well as estimating future levels of patent applications is an ongoing activity of considerable significance. The patent applications filings (PAF) are complex to conduct due to its nonlinearity of influenced factors. Support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. Grey theory is a truly multidisciplinary and generic theory that deals with systems that are characterized by poor information and/or for which information is lacking. Grey system theory successfully utilizes accumulated generating data instead of original data to build forecasting model, which makes raw data stochastic weak, or reduces noise influence in a certain extent. However, the application combining grey system theory and SVM for PAF forecasting is rare. In this study, a grey support vector machines with genetic algorithms (GSVMG) is proposed to forecast PAF. In addition, Grey system is used to add a grey layer before neural input layer and white layer after SVM layer. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques. The experiments show that the GSVMG model is outperformed grey model and SVM with genetic algorithms (SVMG) model and PAF forecasting based on GSVMG is of validity and feasibility. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein subcellular localization is a challenging problem, particularly when the system concerned contains both singleplex and multiplex proteins. In this paper, by introducing the "multi-label scale" and hybridizing the information of gene ontology with the sequential evolution information, a novel predictor called iLoc-Gneg is developed for predicting the subcellular localization of gram-positive bacterial proteins with both single-location and multiple-location sites. For facilitating comparison, the same stringent benchmark dataset used to estimate the accuracy of Gneg-mPLoc was adopted to demonstrate the power of iLoc-Gneg. The dataset contains 1,392 gram-negative bacterial proteins classified into the following eight locations: (1) cytoplasm, (2) extracellular, (3) fimbrium, (4) flagellum, (5) inner membrane, (6) nucleoid, (7) outer membrane, and (8) periplasm. Of the 1,392 proteins, 1,328 are each with only one subcellular location and the other 64 are each with two subcellular locations, but none of the proteins included has pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset (subcellular location). It was observed that the overall success rate by jackknife test on such a stringent benchmark dataset by iLoc-Gneg was over 91{\%}, which is about 6{\%} higher than that by Gneg-mPLoc. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Gneg is freely accessible to the public at http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/iLoc-Gneg. Meanwhile, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results. Furthermore, for the user's convenience, the iLoc-Gneg web-server also has the function to accept the batch job submission, which is not available in the existing version of Gneg-mPLoc web-server. It is anticipated that iLoc-Gneg may become a useful high throughput tool for Molecular Cell Biology, Proteomics, System Biology, and Drug Development.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed much progress in computational modelling for protein subcellular localization. However, the existing sequence-based predictive models demonstrate moderate or unsatisfactory performance, and the gene ontology (GO) based models may take the risk of performance overestimation for novel proteins. Furthermore, many human proteins have multiple subcellular locations, which renders the computational modelling more complicated. Up to the present, there are far few researches specialized for predicting the subcellular localization of human proteins that may reside in multiple cellular compartments. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for human protein subcellular localization (MLMK-TLM). MLMK-TLM proposes a multi-label confusion matrix, formally formulates three multi-labelling performance measures and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which to further extends our published work GO-TLM (gene ontology based transfer learning model for protein subcellular localization) and MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for multiplex human protein subcellular localization. With the advantages of proper homolog knowledge transfer, comprehensive survey of model performance for novel protein and multi-labelling capability, MLMK-TLM will gain more practical applicability. The experiments on human protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM significantly outperforms the baseline model and demonstrates good multi-labelling ability for novel human proteins. Some findings (predictions) are validated by the latest Swiss-Prot database. The software can be freely downloaded at http://soft.synu.edu.cn/upload/msy.rar.},

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial role in transcription and gene-regulation. This paper describes a support vector machine (SVM) based method for discriminating and classifying RNA-binding and non-binding proteins using sequence features. With the threshold of 30{\%} interacting residues, RNA-binding amino acid prediction method PPRINT achieved the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.32. BLAST and PSI-BLAST identified RBPs with the coverage of 32.63 and 33.16{\%}, respectively, at the e-value of 1e-4. The SVM models developed with amino acid, dipeptide and four-part amino acid compositions showed the MCC of 0.60, 0.46, and 0.53, respectively. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile has been successfully used for predicting RBPs. We achieved the maximum MCC of 0.62 using SVM model based on PSSM called PSSM-400. Finally, we developed different hybrid approaches and achieved maximum MCC of 0.66. We also developed a method for predicting three subclasses of RNA binding proteins (e. g., rRNA, tRNA, mRNA binding proteins). The performance of the method was also evaluated on an independent dataset of 69 RBPs and 100 non-RBPs (NBPs). An additional benchmarking was also performed using gene ontology (GO) based annotation. Based on the hybrid approach a web-server RNApred has been developed for predicting RNA binding proteins from amino acid sequences (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/rnapred/).

abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach. RESULTS: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods have been implemented in R package seqlm that is available through Github: https://github.com/raivokolde/seqlm CONTACT: rkolde@gmail.com SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Here we assessed the use of domain families for predicting the functions of whole proteins. These 'functional families' (FunFams) were derived using a protocol that combines sequence clustering with supervised cluster evaluation, relying on available high-quality Gene Ontology (GO) annotation data in the latter step. In essence, the protocol groups domain sequences belonging to the same superfamily into families based on the GO annotations of their parent proteins. An initial test based on enzyme sequences confirmed that the FunFams resemble enzyme (domain) families much better than do families produced by sequence clustering alone. For the CAFA 2011 experiment, we further associated the FunFams with GO terms probabilistically. All target proteins were first submitted to domain superfamily assignment, followed by FunFam assignment and, eventually, function assignment. The latter included an integration step for multi-domain target proteins. The CAFA results put our domain-based approach among the top ten of 31 competing groups and 56 prediction methods, confirming that it outperforms simple pairwise whole-protein sequence comparisons.},

abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore{\textgreater}0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

abstract = {The frequent emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent demand for new antimicrobial agents. Traditional methods of novel antibiotic development are almost obsolete. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are now regarded as a potential solution to revive the traditional methods of antibiotic development, although, until now, many AMPs have failed in clinical trials. A comprehensive database of AMPs with information about their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity will help promote the process of finding novel AMPs with improved antimicrobial activity and reduced cytotoxicity and eventually accelerate the speed of translating the discovery of new AMPs into clinical or preclinical trials. LAMP, a database linking AMPs, serves as a tool to aid the discovery and design of AMPs as new antimicrobial agents. The current version of LAMP has 5,547 entries, comprising 3,904 natural AMPs and 1,643 synthetic peptides. The database can be queried using either simply keywords or combinatorial conditions searches. Equipped with the detailed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity data, the cross-linking and top similar AMPs functions implemented in LAMP will help enhance our current understanding of AMPs and this may speed up the development of new AMPs for medical applications.

abstract = {Motivation: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) take over 5-10{\%} of the eukaryotic proteome and play key roles in many biological processes, e.g. gene regulation. Experimental detection of RBP binding sites is still time-intensive and high-costly. Instead, computational prediction of the RBP binding sites using patterns learned from existing annotation knowledge is a fast approach. From the biological point of view, the local structure context derived from local sequences will be recognized by specific RBPs. However, in computational modeling using deep learning, to our best knowledge, only global representations of entire RNA sequences are employed. So far, the local sequence information is ignored in the deep model construction process. Results: In this study, we present a computational method iDeepE to predict RNA-protein binding sites from RNA sequences by combining global and local convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For the global CNN, we pad the RNA sequences into the same length. For the local CNN, we split a RNA sequence into multiple overlapping fixed-length subsequences, where each subsequence is a signal channel of the whole sequence. Next, we train deep CNNs for multiple subsequences and the padded sequences to learn high-level features, respectively. Finally, the outputs from local and global CNNs are combined to improve the prediction. iDeepE demonstrates a better performance over state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets derived from CLIP-seq. We also find that the local CNN runs 1.8 times faster than the global CNN with comparable performance when using GPUs. Our results show that iDeepE has captured experimentally verified binding motifs. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepE.

abstract = {Precise information about protein locations in a cell facilitates in the understanding of the function of a protein and its interaction in the cellular environment. This information further helps in the study of the specific metabolic pathways and other biological processes. We propose an ensemble approach called "CE-PLoc" for predicting subcellular locations based on fusion of individual classifiers. The proposed approach utilizes features obtained from both dipeptide composition (DC) and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) based feature extraction strategies. Different feature spaces are obtained by varying the dimensionality using PseAAC for a selected base learner. The performance of the individual learning mechanisms such as support vector machine, nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, covariant discriminant, which are trained using PseAAC based features is first analyzed. Classifiers are developed using same learning mechanism but trained on PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. These classifiers are combined through voting strategy and an improvement in prediction performance is achieved. Prediction performance is further enhanced by developing CE-PLoc through the combination of different learning mechanisms trained on both DC based feature space and PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. The predictive performance of proposed CE-PLoc is evaluated for two benchmark datasets of protein subcellular locations using accuracy. MCC, and Q-statistics. Using the jackknife test, prediction accuracies of 81.47 and 83.99{\%} are obtained for 12 and 14 subcellular locations datasets, respectively. In case of independent dataset test, prediction accuracies are 87.04 and 87.33{\%} for 12 and 14 class datasets, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA-binding proteins are vital for the study of cellular processes. In recent genome engineering studies, the identification of proteins with certain functions has become increasingly important and needs to be performed rapidly and efficiently. In previous years, several approaches have been developed to improve the identification of DNA-binding proteins. However, the currently available resources are insufficient to accurately identify these proteins. Because of this, the previous research has been limited by the relatively unbalanced accuracy rate and the low identification success of the current methods. RESULTS: In this paper, we explored the practicality of modelling DNA binding identification and simultaneously employed an ensemble classifier, and a new predictor (nDNA-Prot) was designed. The presented framework is comprised of two stages: a 188-dimension feature extraction method to obtain the protein structure and an ensemble classifier designated as imDC. Experiments using different datasets showed that our method is more successful than the traditional methods in identifying DNA-binding proteins. The identification was conducted using a feature that selected the minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR). An accuracy rate of 95.80{\%} and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.986 were obtained in a cross validation. A test dataset was tested in our method and resulted in an 86{\%} accuracy, versus a 76{\%} using iDNA-Prot and a 68{\%} accuracy using DNA-Prot. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can help to accurately identify DNA-binding proteins, and the web server is accessible at http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/{\~{}}songli/nDNA. In addition, we also predicted possible DNA-binding protein sequences in all of the sequences from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed much progress in computational modeling for protein subcellular localization. However, there are far few computational models for predicting plant protein subcellular multi-localization. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for predicting multiple subcellular locations of plant proteins (MLMK-TLM). The method proposes a multi-label confusion matrix and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which we further extend our published work MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for plant protein subcellular multi-localization. By proper homolog knowledge transfer, MLMK-TLM is applicable to novel plant protein subcellular localization in multi-label learning scenario. The experiments on plant protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM outperforms the baseline model. Unlike the existing models, MLMK-TLM also reports its misleading tendency, which is important for comprehensive survey of model's multi-labeling performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immune defense mechanism of many organisms. Although AMPs have been essentially studied and developed as potential alternatives for fighting infectious diseases, their use as anticancer peptides (ACPs) in cancer therapy either alone or in combination with other conventional drugs has been regarded as a therapeutic strategy to explore. As human cancer remains a cause of high morbidity and mortality worldwide, an urgent need of new, selective, and more efficient drugs is evident. Even though ACPs are expected to be selective toward tumor cells without impairing the normal body physiological functions, the development of a selective ACP has been a challenge. It is not yet possible to predict antitumor activity based on ACPs structures. ACPs are unique molecules when compared to the actual chemotherapeutic arsenal available for cancer treatment and display a variety of modes of action which in some types of cancer seem to co-exist. Regardless the debate surrounding the definition of structure-activity relationships for ACPs, great effort has been invested in ACP design and the challenge of improving effective killing of tumor cells remains. As detailed studies on ACPs mechanisms of action are crucial for optimizing drug development, in this review we provide an overview of the literature concerning peptides' structure, modes of action, selectivity, and efficacy and also summarize some of the many ACPs studied and/or developed for targeting different solid and hematologic malignancies with special emphasis on the first group. Strategies described for drug development and for increasing peptide selectivity toward specific cells while reducing toxicity are also discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUD: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays important roles on gene regulation. Study of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing brings the availability of DNA methylation at single CpG resolution. The main interest of study on DNA methylation data is to test the methylation difference under two conditions of biological samples. However, the high cost and complexity of this sequencing experiment limits the number of biological replicates, which brings challenges to the development of statistical methods. RESULTS: Bayesian modeling is well known to be able to borrow strength across the genome, and hence is a powerful tool for high-dimensional-low-sample-size data. In order to provide accurate identification of methylation loci, especially for low coverage data, we propose a full Bayesian partition model to detect differentially methylated loci under two conditions of scientific study. Since hypo-methylation and hyper-methylation have distinct biological implication, it is desirable to differentiate these two types of differential methylation. The advantage of our Bayesian model is that it can produce one-step output of each locus being either equal-, hypo- or hyper-methylated locus without further post-hoc analysis. An R package named as MethyBayes implementing the proposed full Bayesian partition model will be submitted to the bioconductor website upon publication of the manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed full Bayesian partition model outperforms existing methods in terms of power while maintaining a low false discovery rate based on simulation studies and real data analysis including bioinformatics analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Protein secretion is a cell translocation process of major biological and technological significance. The secretion and downstream processing of proteins by recombinant cells is of great commercial interest. The yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is considered a promising host for heterologous protein production. Because yeasts naturally do not secrete as many proteins as filamentous fungi, they can produce secreted recombinant proteins with few contaminants in the medium. An ideal system to address the secretion of a desired protein could be exploited among the native proteins in certain physiological conditions. By applying algorithms to the completed K. lactis genome sequence, such a system could be selected. To this end, we predicted protein subcellular locations and correlated the resulting extracellular secretome with the transcription factors that modulate the cellular response to a particular environmental stimulus. Results: To explore the potential Kluyveromyces lactis extracellular secretome, four computational prediction algorithms were applied to 5076 predicted K. lactis proteins from the genome database. SignalP v3 identified 418 proteins with N-terminal signal peptides. From these 418 proteins, the Phobius algorithm predicted that 176 proteins have no transmembrane domains, and the big-PI Predictor identified 150 proteins as having no glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification sites. WoLF PSORT predicted that the K. lactis secretome consists of 109 putative proteins, excluding subcellular targeting. The transcription regulators of the putative extracellular proteins were investigated by searching for DNA binding sites in their putative promoters. The conditions to favor expression were obtained by searching Gene Ontology terms and using graph theory. Conclusion: A public database of K. lactis secreted proteins and their transcription factors are presented. It consists of 109 ORFs and 23 transcription factors. A graph created from this database shows 134 nodes and 884 edges, suggesting a vast number of relationships to be validated experimentally. Most of the transcription factors are related to responses to stress such as drug, acid and heat resistance, as well as nitrogen limitation, and may be useful for inducing maximal expression of potential extracellular proteins.},

abstract = {Some creatures living in extremely low temperatures can produce some special materials called "antifreeze proteins" (AFPs), which can prevent the cell and body fluids from freezing. AFPs are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, fungi, etc. Although AFPs have a common function, they show a high degree of diversity in sequences and structures. Therefore, sequence similarity based search methods often fails to predict AFPs from sequence databases. In this work, we report a random forest approach "AFP-Pred" for the prediction of antifreeze proteins from protein sequence. AFP-Pred was trained on the dataset containing 300 AFPs and 300 non-AFPs and tested on the dataset containing 181 AFPs and 9193 non-AFPs. AFP-Pred achieved 81.33{\%} accuracy from training and 83.38{\%} from testing. The performance of AFP-Pred was compared with BLAST and HMM. High prediction accuracy and successful of prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that AFP-Pred can be a useful approach to identify antifreeze proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.},

abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

The first one is to present specialized measures directed to assess the imbalance level in multilabel datasets (MLDs). Using these measures we will be able to conclude which MLDs are imbalanced, and therefore would need an appropriate treatment The second objective is to propose several algorithms designed to reduce the imbalance in MLDs in a classifier-independent way, by means of resampling techniques. Two different approaches to divide the instances in minority and majority groups are studied. One of them considers each label combination as class identifier, whereas the other one performs an individual evaluation of each label imbalance level. A random undersampling and a random oversampling algorithm are proposed for each approach, giving as result four different algorithms. All of them are experimentally tested and their effectiveness is statistically evaluated. From the results obtained, a set of guidelines directed to show when these methods should be applied is also provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Deep learning offers a new opportunity to significantly improve prediction accuracy. In this article, a new deep neural network architecture, named the Deep inception-inside-inception (Deep3I) network, is proposed for protein secondary structure prediction and implemented as a software tool MUFOLD-SS. The input to MUFOLD-SS is a carefully designed feature matrix corresponding to the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which consists of a rich set of information derived from individual amino acid, as well as the context of the protein sequence. Specifically, the feature matrix is a composition of physio-chemical properties of amino acids, PSI-BLAST profile, and HHBlits profile. MUFOLD-SS is composed of a sequence of nested inception modules and maps the input matrix to either eight states or three states of secondary structures. The architecture of MUFOLD-SS enables effective processing of local and global interactions between amino acids in making accurate prediction. In extensive experiments on multiple datasets, MUFOLD-SS outperformed the best existing methods and other deep neural networks significantly.

In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been utilized as potential alternatives for infection therapeutics. AMPs are key components of the innate immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria. Identifying AMPs and their functional types has led to many studies, and various predictors using machine learning have been developed. However, there is room for improvement; in particular, no predictor takes into account the lack of balance among different functional AMPs. RESULTS: In this paper, a new synthetic minority over-sampling technique on imbalanced and multi-label datasets, referred to as ML-SMOTE, was designed for processing and identifying AMPs' functional families. A novel multi-label classifier, MLAMP, was also developed using ML-SMOTE and grey pseudo amino acid composition. The classifier obtained 0.4846 subset accuracy and 0.16 hamming loss.

With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying the sigma(54) promoters. Here, a predictor called 'iPro54-PseKNC' was developed. In the predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a novel feature vector called 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', which was further optimized by the incremental feature selection procedure. The performance of iPro54-PseKNC was examined by the rigorous jackknife cross-validation tests on a stringent benchmark data set. As a user-friendly web-server, iPro54-PseKNC is freely accessible at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iPro54-PseKNC. For the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step protocol guide was provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematics that were presented in this paper just for its integrity. Meanwhile, we also discovered through an in-depth statistical analysis that the distribution of distances between the transcription start sites and the translation initiation sites were governed by the gamma distribution, which may provide a fundamental physical principle for studying the sigma(54) promoters.},

abstract = {Over the years, there have been claims that evolution proceeds according to systematically different processes over different timescales and that protein evolution behaves in a non-Markovian manner. On the other hand, Markov models are fundamental to many applications in evolutionary studies. Apparent non-Markovian or time-dependent behavior has been attributed to influence of the genetic code at short timescales and dominance of physicochemical properties of the amino acids at long timescales. However, any long time period is simply the accumulation of many short time periods, and it remains unclear why evolution should appear to act systematically differently across the range of timescales studied. We show that the observed time-dependent behavior can be explained qualitatively by modeling protein sequence evolution as an aggregated Markov process (AMP): a time-homogeneous Markovian substitution model observed only at the level of the amino acids encoded by the protein-coding DNA sequence. The study of AMPs sheds new light on the relationship between amino acid-level and codon-level models of sequence evolution, and our results suggest that protein evolution should be modeled at the codon level rather than using amino acid substitution models.},

Although such approaches can be very simple to implement, tuning them most effectively is not an easy task. In particular, it is unclear whether oversampling is more effective than undersampling and which oversampling or undersampling rate should be used. This paper presents an experimental study of these questions and concludes that combining different expressions of the resampling approach is an effective solution to the tuning problem. The proposed combination scheme is evaluated on imbalanced subsets of the Reuters-21578 text collection and is shown to be quite effective for these problems.},

abstract = {A genetic-based fuzzy grey prediction model is proposed in this paper. Instead of working on the conventional bit by bit operation, both the crossover and mutation operators are real-valued handled by the presented algorithms. To prevent the system from turning into a premature problem, we select the elitists from two groups of possible solutions to reproduce the new populations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithms, two simple functions are first tested. The results show that our method outperforms the conventional one no matter whether from the viewpoint of the number of iterations required to find the optimum solutions or from the final solutions obtained. The real-valued genetic algorithms are then exploited to optimize the fuzzy controller which is designed to perform the compensation job. Two different types of fuzzy inference rules are considered to compensate for the predicted errors from the grey model. The difficulty encountered in applying the genetic algorithms to adjusting the fuzzy parameters is also discussed. Based on the simulation results from the problems of the weather forecast, we found that the proposed methodology is very effective in determining the quantity of compensation for the predicted outputs from the traditional grey approach.

The dynamic response of the platform has strong non-linear and time-variant characteristics, so neither traditional passive control methods nor active control methods based on accurate mathematical models can effectively dampen the vibrations. A new kind of adaptive inverse control method, based on a combination of grey forecasting and a support vector machine, was developed and applied to control the vibration of offshore platforms in combination with the dynamic stiffness matrix method. Numerical results show that the new control method can effectively decrease the vibration response of a structure to wave and wind loads and can solve time delay problems caused by lags in control signal transmission.},

abstract = {Computational methods for predicting protein subcellular localization have used various types of features, including N-terminal sorting signals, amino acid compositions, and text annotations from protein databases. Our approach does not use biological knowledge such as the sorting signals or homologues, but use just protein sequence information. The method divides a protein sequence into short k-mer sequence fragments which can be mapped to word features in document classification. A large number of class association rules are mined from the protein sequence examples that range from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. Then, a boosting algorithm is applied to those rules to build up a final classifier. Experimental results using benchmark data sets show that our method is excellent in terms of both the classification performance and the test coverage. The result also implies that the k-mer sequence features which determine subcellular locations do not necessarily exist in specific positions of a protein sequence.

By choosing the 1-peptide compositions on the N-terminal regions with 20 residues as the only input vector, the prediction performance achieves 86.86{\%} accuracy with 0.69 Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) by the jackknife test. Moreover, by combining with the hydropathy distribution along protein sequence and several reduced amino acid alphabets, we achieved maximum MCC 0.82 with accuracy 92{\%} in the jackknife test by using the developed ID model. When evaluating on an independent dataset our method performs better than existing methods.

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many fundamental biological processes essential for cellular function. Most of the existing computational approaches employed only the sequence context of the target residue for its prediction. In the present study, for each target residue, we applied both the spatial context and the sequence context to construct the feature space. Subsequently, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was applied to remove the redundancies in the feature space. Finally, a predictor (PDNAsite) was developed through the integration of the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and ensemble learning. Results on the PDNA-62 and the PDNA-224 datasets demonstrate that features extracted from spatial context provide more information than those from sequence context and the combination of them gives more performance gain. An analysis of the number of binding sites in the spatial context of the target site indicates that the interactions between binding sites next to each other are important for protein-DNA recognition and their binding ability. The comparison between our proposed PDNAsite method and the existing methods indicate that PDNAsite outperforms most of the existing methods and is a useful tool for DNA-binding site identification. A web-server of our predictor (http://hlt.hitsz.edu.cn:8080/PDNAsite/) is made available for free public accessible to the biological research community.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines the image modeling strengths of the bag of words framework with the representational power and adaptability of learning deep architectures. Local gradient-based descriptors, such as SIFT, are encoded via a hierarchical coding scheme composed of spatial aggregating restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). For each coding layer, we regularize the RBM by encouraging representations to fit both sparse and selective distributions. Supervised fine-tuning is used to enhance the quality of the visual representation for the categorization task. We performed a thorough experimental evaluation using three image categorization data sets. The hierarchical coding scheme achieved competitive categorization accuracies of 79.7{\%} and 86.4{\%} on the Caltech-101 and 15-Scenes data sets, respectively. The visual representations learned are compact and the model's inference is fast, as compared with sparse coding methods. The low-level representations of descriptors that were learned using this method result in generic features that we empirically found to be transferrable between different image data sets. Further analysis reveal the significance of supervised fine-tuning when the architecture has two layers of representations as opposed to a single layer.},

A typical example is the development of prediction algorithms for the subcellular localization sites of input protein sequences. In this review, we mainly focus on the biological grounds of the prediction methods rather than the algorithmic issues because we believe the former will be more fruitful for future development. Recent advances on the study of protein sorting signals will hopefully be incorporated into future prediction methods. Unfortunately, many of the state-of-the-art methods are published without sufficient objective tests. In fact, a simple test employed in this article shows that the performance of specifically developed predictors is not significantly better than that of a homology search. We suspect that this is a general problem associated with the interpretation of genome sequences, which have evolved through gene duplication and speciation.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important yet challenging problem. Recently, several computational methods based on Gene Ontology (GO) have been proposed to tackle this problem and have demonstrated superiority over methods based on other features. Existing GO-based methods, however, do not fully use the GO information. This paper proposes an efficient GO method called GOASVM that exploits the information from the GO term frequencies and distant homologs to represent a protein in the general form of Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition. The method first selects a subset of relevant GO terms to form a GO vector space. Then for each protein, the method uses the accession number (AC) of the protein or the ACs of its homologs to find the number of occurrences of the selected GO terms in the Gene Ontology annotation (GOA) database as a means to construct GO vectors for support vector machines (SVMs) classification. With the advantages of GO term frequencies and a new strategy to incorporate useful homologous information, GOASVM can achieve a prediction accuracy of 72.2{\%} on a new independent test set comprising novel proteins that were added to Swiss-Prot six years later than the creation date of the training set. GOASVM and Supplementary materials are available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/mGoaSvmServer/GOASVM.html.},

abstract = {To design and discover new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with high levels of antimicrobial activity, a number of machine-learning methods and prediction methods have been developed. Here, we present a new prediction method that can identify novel AMPs that are highly similar in sequence to known peptides but offer improved antimicrobial activity along with lower host cytotoxicity. Using previously generated AMP amino acid substitution data, we developed an amino acid activity contribution matrix that contained an activity contribution value for each amino acid in each position of the model peptide. A series of AMPs were designed with this method. After evaluating the antimicrobial activities of these novel AMPs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, DP7 was chosen for further analysis. Compared to the parent peptide HH2, this novel AMP showed broad-spectrum, improved antimicrobial activity, and in a cytotoxicity assay it showed lower toxicity against human cells. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of DP7 was tested in a Staphylococcus aureus infection murine model. When inoculated and treated via intraperitoneal injection, DP7 reduced the bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage solution. Electron microscope imaging and the results indicated disruption of the S. aureus outer membrane by DP7. Our new prediction method can therefore be employed to identify AMPs possessing minor amino acid differences with improved antimicrobial activities, potentially increasing the therapeutic agents available to combat multidrug-resistant infections.},

Here, we present a pedagogical study in two contrasting parallel biochemistry introductory courses to compare student surface and deep learning. Surface and deep learning were measured quantitatively by a study process questionnaire at the start and end of the semester, and qualitatively by questionnaires and interviews with students. In the traditional lecture/examination based course, there was a dramatic shift to surface learning approaches through the semester. In the course that emphasized student engagement and adopted multiple forms of assessment, a preference for deep learning was sustained with only a small reduction through the semester. Such evidence for the benefits of implementing student engagement and more diverse non-examination based assessment has important implications for the design, delivery, and renewal of introductory courses in biochemistry and molecular biology.

@article{Chou2007c,
abstract = {One of the critical challenges in predicting protein subcellular localization is how to deal with the case of multiple location sites. Unfortunately, so far, no efforts have been made in this regard except for the one focused on the proteins in budding yeast only. For most existing predictors, the multiple-site proteins are either excluded from consideration or assumed even not existing. Actually, proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. For instance, according to the Swiss-Prot database (version 50.7, released 19-Sept-2006), among the 33,925 eukaryotic protein entries that have experimentally observed subcellular location annotations, 2715 have multiple location sites, meaning about 8{\%} bearing the multiplex feature. Proteins with multiple locations or dynamic feature of this kind are particularly interesting because they may have some very special biological functions intriguing to investigators in both basic research and drug discovery. Meanwhile, according to the same Swiss-Prot database, the number of total eukaryotic protein entries (except those annotated with "fragment" or those with less than 50 amino acids) is 90,909, meaning a gap of (90,909-33,925) = 56,984 entries for which no knowledge is available about their subcellular locations. Although one can use the computational approach to predict the desired information for the blank, so far, all the existing methods for predicting eukaryotic protein subcellular localization are limited in the case of single location site only. To overcome such a barrier, a new ensemble classifier, named Euk-mPLoc, was developed that can be used to deal with the case of multiple location sites as well. Euk-mPLoc is freely accessible to the public as a Web server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk-multi. Meanwhile, to support the people working in the relevant areas, Euk-mPLoc has been used to identify all eukaryotic protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results thus obtained have been deposited at the same Web site via a downloadable file prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab{\_}Euk-mPLoc.xls". Furthermore, to include new entries of eukaryotic proteins and reflect the continuous development of Euk-mPLoc in both the coverage scope and prediction accuracy, we will timely update the downloadable file as well as the predictor, and keep users informed by publishing a short note in the Journal and making an announcement in the Web Page.},

@article{Legendre2018,
abstract = {Background: RNA structure prediction is an important field in bioinformatics, and numerous methods and tools have been proposed. Pseudoknots are specific motifs of RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure. Results: We propose here an original method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of RNA secondary structure prediction, namely MEA and MFE. The resulting tool, called BiokoP, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F1-score) is, in most cases, given by BiokoP. Moreover, the results of BiokoP are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F1-scores are always higher than 70{\%} for any number of solutions returned. Conclusion: The results obtained by BiokoP show that combining the MEA and the MFE models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the MEA and the MFE models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models. BiokoP is available on the EvryRNA platform: https://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.},

abstract = {The cerebellum is known to play a critical role in learning relevant patterns of activity for adaptive motor control, but the underlying network mechanisms are only partly understood. The classical long-term synaptic plasticity between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), which is driven by the inferior olive (IO), can only account for limited aspects of learning. Recently, the role of additional forms of plasticity in the granular layer, molecular layer and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) has been considered. In particular, learning at DCN synapses allows for generalization, but convergence to a stable state requires hundreds of repetitions. In this paper we have explored the putative role of the IO-DCN connection by endowing it with adaptable weights and exploring its implications in a closed-loop robotic manipulation task. Our results show that IO-DCN plasticity accelerates convergence of learning by up to two orders of magnitude without conflicting with the generalization properties conferred by DCN plasticity. Thus, this model suggests that multiple distributed learning mechanisms provide a key for explaining the complex properties of procedural learning and open up new experimental questions for synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar network.},

Once the sample dataset is not balanced , the classification performance drops sharply. To efficiently deal with the imbalance of data, an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm is proposed in this work. Firstly, we construct artificial samples so that more minority-class's data can be obtained via optimizing GAN loss function. Secondly, we build a fully-connected network for structured data classification. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted on two open structured-datasets and the results of the proposed algorithm demonstrate a good applicability for the classification of structured data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is crucial for understanding its functions. The subcellular pattern of a protein is typically represented as the set of cellular components in which it is located, and an important task is to determine this set from microscope images. In this article, we address this classification problem using confocal immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project. The HPA contains images of cells stained for many proteins; each is also stained for three reference components, but there are many other components that are invisible. Given one such cell, the task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein. We first randomly select local image regions within the cells, and then extract various carefully designed features from these regions. This region-based approach enables us to explicitly study the relationship between proteins and different cell components, as well as the interactions between these components. To achieve these two goals, we propose two discriminative models that extend logistic regression with structured latent variables. The first model allows the same protein pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying components in different regions. The second model further captures the spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that we can better infer these components. To learn these models, we propose a fast approximate algorithm for inference, and then use gradient-based methods to maximize the data likelihood. RESULTS: In the experiments, we show that the proposed models help improve the classification accuracies on synthetic data and real cellular images. The best overall accuracy we report in this article for classifying 942 proteins into 13 classes of patterns is about 84.6{\%}, which to our knowledge is the best so far. In addition, the dependencies learned are consistent with prior knowledge of cell organization. AVAILABILITY: http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/.

abstract = {Predicting subcellular localization of human proteins is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins may have a multiplex character, i.e., simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. In a previous study, we developed a predictor called "Hum-mPLoc" to deal with the multiplex problem for the human protein system. However, Hum-mPLoc has the following shortcomings. (1) The input of accession number for a query protein is required in order to obtain a higher expected success rate by selecting to use the higher-level prediction pathway; but many proteins, such as synthetic and hypothetical proteins as well as those newly discovered proteins without being deposited into databanks yet, do not have accession numbers. (2) Neither functional domain nor sequential evolution information were taken into account in Hum-mPLoc, and hence its power may be reduced accordingly. In view of this, a top-down strategy to address these shortcomings has been implemented. The new predictor thus obtained is called Hum-mPLoc 2.0, where the accession number for input is no longer needed whatsoever. Moreover, both the functional domain information and the sequential evolution information have been fused into the predictor by an ensemble classifier. As a consequence, the prediction power has been significantly enhanced. The web server of Hum-mPLoc2.0 is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/hum-multi-2/.},

With the avalanche of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic age, to expedite the process of drug discovery, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method to rapidly identify GPCRs and their types. A new predictor was developed by hybridizing two different modes of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC): the functional domain PseAAC and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum PseAAC. The new predictor is called GPCR-2L, where "2L" means that it is a two-layer predictor: the 1st layer prediction engine is to identify a query protein as GPCR or not; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it as belonging to one of the following six types: (1) rhodopsin-like (Class A), (2) secretin-like (Class B), (3) metabotropic glutamate/pheromone (Class C), (4) fungal pheromone (Class D), (5) cAMP receptor (Class E), or (6) frizzled/smoothened family (Class F). The overall success rate of GPCR-2L in identifying proteins as GPCRs or non-GPCRs is over 97.2{\%}, while identifying GPCRs among their six types is over 97.8{\%}. Such high success rates were derived by the rigorous jackknife cross-validation on a stringent benchmark dataset, in which none of the included proteins had {\textgreater}/=40{\%} pairwise sequence identity to any other protein in a same subset. As a user-friendly web-server, GPCR-2L is freely accessible to the public at , by which one can obtain the 2-level results in about 20 s for a query protein sequence of 500 amino acids. The longer the sequence is, the more time it may usually need. The high success rates reported here indicate that it is a quite effective approach to identify GPCRs and their types with the functional domain information and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum analysis. It is anticipated that GPCR-2L may become a useful tool for both basic research and drug development in the areas related to GPCRs.},

abstract = {Community detection was a hot topic on network analysis, where the main aim is to perform unsupervised learning or clustering in networks. Recently, semi-supervised learning has received increasing attention among researchers. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called weighted inverse Laplacian (WIL), for predicting labels in partially labeled networks. The idea comes from the first hitting time in random walk, and it also has nice explanations both in information propagation and the regularization framework. We propose a partially labeled degree-corrected block model (pDCBM) to describe the generation of partially labeled networks. We show that WIL ensures the misclassification rate is of order {\$}O(\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}d{\}}){\$} for the pDCBM with average degree {\$}d=\backslashOmega(\backslashlog n),{\$} and that it can handle situations with greater unbalanced than traditional Laplacian methods. WIL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in most of our simulations and real datasets, especially in unbalanced networks and heterogeneous networks.},

abstract = {Information about the interactions of drug compounds with proteins in cellular networking is very important for drug development. Unfortunately, all the existing predictors for identifying drug-protein interactions were trained by a skewed benchmark data-set where the number of non-interactive drug-protein pairs is overwhelmingly larger than that of the interactive ones. Using this kind of highly unbalanced benchmark data-set to train predictors would lead to the outcome that many interactive drug-protein pairs might be mispredicted as non-interactive. Since the minority interactive pairs often contain the most important information for drug design, it is necessary to minimize this kind of misprediction. In this study, we adopted the neighborhood cleaning rule and synthetic minority over-sampling technique to treat the skewed benchmark datasets and balance the positive and negative subsets. The new benchmark datasets thus obtained are called the optimized benchmark datasets, based on which a new predictor called iDrug-Target was developed that contains four sub-predictors: iDrug-GPCR, iDrug-Chl, iDrug-Ezy, and iDrug-NR, specialized for identifying the interactions of drug compounds with GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), ion channels, enzymes, and NR (nuclear receptors), respectively. Rigorous cross-validations on a set of experiment-confirmed datasets have indicated that these new predictors remarkably outperformed the existing ones for the same purpose. To maximize users' convenience, a public accessible Web server for iDrug-Target has been established at [GRAPHICS] , by which users can easily get their desired results. It has not escaped our notice that the aforementioned strategy can be widely used in many other areas as well.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Gene Ontology is a controlled vocabulary for representing knowledge related to genes and proteins in a computable form. The current effort of manually annotating proteins with the Gene Ontology is outpaced by the rate of accumulation of biomedical knowledge in literature, which urges the development of text mining approaches to facilitate the process by automatically extracting the Gene Ontology annotation from literature. The task is usually cast as a text classification problem, and contemporary methods are confronted with unbalanced training data and the difficulties associated with multi-label classification. RESULTS: In this research, we investigated the methods of enhancing automatic multi-label classification of biomedical literature by utilizing the structure of the Gene Ontology graph. We have studied three graph-based multi-label classification algorithms, including a novel stochastic algorithm and two top-down hierarchical classification methods for multi-label literature classification. We systematically evaluated and compared these graph-based classification algorithms to a conventional flat multi-label algorithm. The results indicate that, through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods can significantly improve predictions of the Gene Ontology terms implied by the analyzed text. Furthermore, the graph-based multi-label classifiers are capable of suggesting Gene Ontology annotations (to curators) that are closely related to the true annotations even if they fail to predict the true ones directly. A software package implementing the studied algorithms is available for the research community. CONCLUSION: Through utilizing the information from the structure of the Gene Ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods have better potential than the conventional flat multi-label classification approach to facilitate protein annotation based on the literature.},

The prediction accuracy of the existing methods has significant room for improvement. A recent deep-learning architecture, Capsule Network (CapsNet), which can characterize the internal hierarchical representation of input data, presents a great opportunity to solve this problem, especially using small training data. Results: We proposed a CapsNet for predicting protein PTM sites, including phosphorylation, N-linked glycosylation, N6-acetyllysine, methyl-arginine, S-palmitoyl-cysteine, pyrrolidone-carboxylic-acid and SUMOylation sites. The CapsNet outperformed the baseline convolutional neural network architecture MusiteDeep and other well-known tools in most cases and provided promising results for practical use, especially in learning from small training data. The capsule length also gives an accurate estimate for the confidence of the PTM prediction. We further demonstrated that the internal capsule features could be trained as a motif detector of phosphorylation sites when no kinase-specific phosphorylation labels were provided. In addition, CapsNet generates robust representations that have strong discriminant power in distinguishing kinase substrates from different kinase families. Our study sheds some light on the recognition mechanism of PTMs and applications of CapsNet on other bioinformatic problems.},

To detect emotion from nonstationary EEG signals, a sophisticated learning algorithm that can represent high-level abstraction is required. This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network (DLN) to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder (SAE) using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore, covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLNis capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52{\%} and 46.03{\%}, respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55{\%} and 6.53{\%}. Moreover, DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.},

The main idea is to severely under sample the majority class thus creating a large number of distinct training sets. For each training set we then find a decision boundary which separates the minority class from the majority class. By combining the multiple designs through fusion, we construct a composite boundary between the majority class and the minority class. The proposed methodology is applied on 22 UCI data sets and experimental results indicate a significant increase in performance when compared with many existing class-imbalance learning methods.

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure determination has primarily been performed using X-ray crystallography. To overcome the expensive cost, high attrition rate and series of trial-and-error settings, many in-silico methods have been developed to predict crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. However, the majority of these methods build their predictors by extracting features from protein sequences, which is computationally expensive and can explode the feature space. We propose DeepCrystal, a deep learning framework for sequence-based protein crystallization prediction. It uses deep learning to identify proteins which can produce diffraction quality crystals without the need to manually engineer additional biochemical and structural features from sequence. Our model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can exploit frequently occurring k-mers and sets of k-mers from the protein sequences to distinguish proteins that will result in diffraction quality crystals from those that will not. Results: Our model surpasses previous sequence-based protein crystallization predictors in terms of recall, F-score, accuracy and MCC on three independent test sets. DeepCrystal achieves an average improvement of 1.4{\%}, 12.1{\%} in recall, when compared to its closest competitors, Crysalis II and Crysf respectively. In addition, DeepCrystal attains an average improvement of 2.1{\%}, 6.0{\%} for F-score, 1.9{\%}, 3.9{\%} for accuracy and 3.8{\%}, 7.0{\%} for MCC w.r.t.

In this work, we have systematically analyzed the composition of amino acid residues for proteins with different ranges of folding rates. We observed that the polar residues, Asn, Gln, Ser, and Lys, are dominant in fast folding proteins whereas the hydrophobic residues, Ala, Cys, Gly, and Leu, prefer to be in slow folding proteins. Further, we have developed a method based on quadratic response surface models for predicting the folding rates of 77 two- and three-state proteins. Our method showed a correlation of 0.90 between experimental and predicted protein folding rates using leave-one-out cross-validation method. The classification of proteins based on structural class improved the correlation to 0.98 and it is 0.99, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively, for all-alpha, all-beta, and mixed class proteins. In addition, we have utilized Baysean classification theory for discriminating two- and three-state proteins, which showed an accuracy of 90{\%}.

RESULTS: Our graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have achieved excellent recognition performance in various visual recognition tasks. A large labeled training set is one of the most important factors for its success. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient training images with precise labels in some domains such as apparent age estimation, head pose estimation, multi-label classification and semantic segmentation. Fortunately, there is ambiguous information among labels, which makes these tasks different from traditional classification. Based on this observation, we convert the label of each image into a discrete label distribution, and learn the label distribution by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and ground-truth label distributions using deep ConvNets. The proposed DLDL (Deep Label Distribution Learning) method effectively utilizes the label ambiguity in both feature learning and classifier learning, which help prevent the network from over-fitting even when the training set is small. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods for age estimation and head pose estimation. At the same time, it also improves recognition performance for multi-label classification and semantic segmentation tasks.},

abstract = {We consider the regression problem for financial time series. Typically, financial time series are non-stationary and volatile in nature. Because of its good generalization power and the tractability of the problem, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been extensively applied in financial time series prediction. The standard SVR adopts the l(p)-norm (p = 1 or 2) to model the functional complexity of the whole data set and employs a fixed c-tube to tolerate noise. Although this approach has proved successful both theoretically and empirically, it considers data in a global fashion only. Therefore it may lack the flexibility to capture the local trend of data; this is a critical aspect of volatile data, especially financial time series data. Aiming to address this issue, we propose the Local Support Vector Regression (LSVR) model. This novel model is demonstrated to provide a systematic and automatic scheme to adapt the margin locally and flexibly; the margin is fixed globally in the standard SVR. Therefore, the LSVR can tolerate noise adaptively. We provide both theoretical justifications and empirical evaluations for this novel model. The experimental results on synthetic data and real financial data demonstrate its advantages over the standard SVR.},

abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are non-coding segments of DNA that play a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression programs. However, systematically and precisely predicting enhancers remain a major challenge. Although existing methods have achieved some success in enhancer prediction, they still suffer from many issues. We developed a deep learning-based algorithmic framework named PEDLA (https://github.com/wenjiegroup/PEDLA), which can directly learn an enhancer predictor from massively heterogeneous data and generalize in ways that are mostly consistent across various cell types/tissues. We first trained PEDLA with 1,114-dimensional heterogeneous features in H1 cells, and demonstrated that PEDLA framework integrates diverse heterogeneous features and gives state-of-the-art performance relative to five existing methods for enhancer prediction. We further extended PEDLA to iteratively learn from 22 training cell types/tissues. Our results showed that PEDLA manifested superior performance consistency in both training and independent test sets. On average, PEDLA achieved 95.0{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} geometric mean (GM) of sensitivity and specificity across 22 training cell types/tissues, as well as 95.7{\%} accuracy and a 96.8{\%} GM across 20 independent test cell types/tissues. Together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to consistently identify regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale from massively heterogeneous data across diverse cell types/tissues.},

Prediction of protein subcellular locations is crucial to the understanding of various protein functions. Therefore, an accurate, computationally efficient and reliable prediction system is required. Results: In this article, the predictions of various Support Vector Machine (SVM) models have been combined through majority voting. The proposed ensemble SVM-SubLoc has achieved the highest success rates of 99.7{\%} using hybrid features of Haralick textures and local binary patterns (HarLBP), 99.4{\%} using hybrid features of Haralick textures and Local Ternary Patterns (HarLTP). In addition, SVM-SubLoc has yielded 99.0{\%} accuracy using only local ternary patterns (LTPs) based features. The dimensionality of HarLBP feature vector is 581 compared with 78 and 52 for HarLTP and LTPs, respectively. Hence, SVM-SubLoc in conjunction with LTPs is fast, sufficiently accurate and simple predictive system. The proposed SVM-SubLoc approach thus provides superior prediction performance using the reduced feature space compared with existing approaches.},

Due to large-scale and complex structure of the DNA dataset, the analysis of DNA sequence is becoming computationally a challenging issue in bioinformatics field and computational biology. Fast algorithms, capable of analyzing large-scale DNA sequence, are now required in the field of bioinformatics. This paper presents a novel Parallel Vector Space Model (PVSM) approach that supports the analysis of large-scale DNA sequence by taking advantages of multi-core system. The proposed approach is built on top of modified Vector Space Model (VSM). In order to evaluate the performance of PVSM, the proposed technique is extensively evaluated using varied size of DNA sequences in the context of computational efficiency and accuracy. The performance of PVSM is compared with sequential modified VSM. The sequential VSM is implemented on a single processor whereas, the proposed method is initially parallelized on 4 processors and subsequently on 12 processors. The experimental results show that the PVSM performed better than the sequential VSM. The proposed method achieved approximately 2× speedup compared with sequential approach, without affecting the accuracy level. Moreover, the proposed PVSM is highly scalable with an increase in the number of processing cores and support the analysis of large-scale DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes are replete with millions of polymorphic sites, among which those genetic variants that are co-located on the same chromosome and exist close to one another form blocks of closely linked mutations known as haplotypes. The linkage within haplotypes is constantly disrupted due to meiotic recombination events. Whole ensembles of such numerous haplotypes are subjected to evolutionary pressure, where mutations influence each other and should be considered as a whole entity - a gigantic matrix, unique for each individual genome. This idea was implemented into a computational approach, named Genome Evolution by Matrix Algorithms (GEMA) to model genomic changes taking into account all mutations in a population. GEMA has been tested for modeling of entire human chromosomes. The program can precisely mimic real biological processes that have influence on genome evolution such as: 1) authentic arrangements of genes and functional genomic elements; 2) frequencies of various types of mutations in different nucleotide contexts; 3) non-random distribution of meiotic recombination events along chromosomes. Computer modeling with GEMA has demonstrated that the number of meiotic recombination events per gamete is among the most crucial factors influencing population fitness. In humans, these recombinations create a gamete genome consisting on an average of 48 pieces of corresponding parental chromosomes. Such highly mosaic gamete structure allows preserving fitness of population under the intense influx of novel mutations (40 per individual) even when the number of mutations with deleterious effects is up to ten times more abundant than those with beneficial effects.},

The aim of this article is to identify and quantify the factors associated with the most frequent AEs from STN DBS in PD-diagnosed patients. The following variables were studied: aborted procedure, misplaced leads, intracranial haemorrhage, and seizures. This study was carried out in 233 patients diagnosed with PD, with 455 STN electrodes implanted and follow-up after 7 (8-14) years follow up. A total amount of 56 SAEs occurred in 49 patients (11.76 {\%} of total procedures, 12.31 {\%} of implanted leads, 21.03 {\%} of patients). SAEs were: five aborted procedures, 26 misplaced leads, ten intracranial haemorrhages, and 15 seizures. Of all the SAEs, long-term effects only happened in two cases of hemiparesis caused by intracranial haemorrhage; the other SAEs were reversible and didn't leave any long-term clinical consequences (0.42 {\%} of procedures, 0.44 {\%} of leads, and 0.86 {\%} of patients). STN DBS in PD patients is a safe surgical procedure, with good risk/benefit ratios: procedure reliability/correct lead implantation in 95.59 {\%}, 0 mortality/implanted lead, 0.12 morbidity/implanted lead, and 0.0043 neurological sequelae/implanted lead.},

Some computational methods treat this problem as a ranking problem and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, such as PSI-BLAST, HHblits and ProtEmbed. This raises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive performance. In this regard, we are to propose a new computational method called ProtDec-LTR for protein remote homology detection, which is able to combine various ranking methods in a supervised manner via using the Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithm derived from natural language processing.Results: Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that ProtDec-LTR can achieve an ROC1 score of 0.8442 and an ROC50 score of 0.9023 outperforming all the individual predictors and some state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that it is correct to treat protein remote homology detection as a ranking problem, and predictive performance improvement can be achieved by combining different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via using LTR.Availability and implementation: For users' convenience, the software tools of three basic ranking predictors and Learning to Rank algorithm were provided at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/ProtDec-LTR/home/Contact:bliu@insun.hit.edu.cnSupplementary information: are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Motivation: Revealing the subcellular localization of proteins within membrane-bound compartments is of a major importance for inferring protein function. Though current high-throughput localization experiments provide valuable data, they are costly and time-consuming, and due to technical difficulties not readily applicable for many Eukaryotes. Physical characteristics of proteins, such as sequence targeting signals and amino acid composition are commonly used to predict subcellular localizations using computational approaches. Recently it was shown that protein protein interaction (PPI) networks can be used to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of protein subcellular localization. However, as high-throughput PPI data depend on costly high-throughput experiments and are currently available for only a few organisms, the scope of such methods is yet limited. Results: This study presents a novel constraint-based method for predicting subcellular localization of enzymes based on their embedding metabolic network, relying on a parsimony principle of a minimal number of cross-membrane metabolite transporters. In a cross-validation test of predicting known subcellular localization of yeast enzymes, the method is shown to be markedly robust, providing accurate localization predictions even when only 20{\%} of the known enzyme localizations are given as input. It is shown to outperform pathway enrichment-based methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and in its ability to predict the subcellular localization of entire metabolic pathways when no a-priori pathway-specific localization data is available (and hence enrichment methods are bound to fail). With the number of available metabolic networks already reaching more than 600 and growing fast, the new method may significantly contribute to the identification of enzyme localizations in many different organisms.},

abstract = {DNA replication, occurring in all living organisms and being the basis for biological inheritance, is the process of producing two identical replicas from one original DNA molecule. To in-depth understand such an important biological process and use it for developing new strategy against genetics diseases, the knowledge of duplication origin sites in DNA is indispensible. With the explosive growth of DNA sequences emerging in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop high throughput tools to identify these regions purely based on the sequence information alone. In this paper, by incorporating the dinucleotide position-specific propensity information into the general pseudo nucleotide composition and using the random forest classifier, a new predictor called iROS-gPseKNC was proposed. Rigorously cross-validations have indicated that the proposed predictor is significantly better than the best existing method in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and stability. Furthermore, a user-friendly web-server for iROS-gPseKNC has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iROS-gPseKNC, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to bother the complicated mathematics, which were presented just for the integrity of the methodology itself.},

The grey predictor is applied to extract key information and reduce the randomness of the measured non-stationary time-series signals from sensors, and send the prediction information to the fuzzy controller. The complete mathematical model is derived and the sufficient condition for convergence is given. To achieve better transient performance and steady-state responses, an on-line switching mechanism is adopted to regulate appropriately the forecasting step size of the grey predictor, according to the error feedback from different periods of the system. response.

abstract = {Usually, objects to be classified are represented by features. In this paper, we discuss an alternative object representation based on dissimilarity values. If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases. For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled through molecular logic circuits that combine regulatory signals of many different factors. In particular, complexation of transcription factors (TFs) and other regulatory proteins is a prevailing and highly conserved mechanism of signal integration within critical regulatory pathways and enables us to infer controlled genes as well as the exerted regulatory mechanism. Common approaches for protein complex prediction that only use protein interaction networks, however, are designed to detect self-contained functional complexes and have difficulties to reveal dynamic combinatorial assemblies of physically interacting proteins. RESULTS: We developed the novel algorithm DACO that combines protein-protein interaction networks and domain-domain interaction networks with the cluster-quality metric cohesiveness. The metric is locally maximized on the holistic level of protein interactions, and connectivity constraints on the domain level are used to account for the exclusive and thus inherently combinatorial nature of the interactions within such assemblies. When applied to predicting TF complexes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed approach outperformed popular complex prediction methods by far. Furthermore, we were able to assign many of the predictions to target genes, as well as to a potential regulatory effect in agreement with literature evidence.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Targeted kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment, but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict. Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene expression and mutation status. High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools for determining kinase dependency, but drug polypharmacology can make results difficult to interpret. RESULTS: We developed Kinase Addiction Ranker (KAR), an algorithm that integrates high-throughput drug screening data, comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene expression profiles to identify kinase dependency in cancer cells. We applied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 151 leukemia patient samples using published datasets. We experimentally validated KAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung cancer cell line H1581, showing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and AZD8055.

abstract = {Protein folding rates vary by several orders of magnitude and they depend on the topology of the fold and the size and composition of the sequence. Although recent works show that the rates can be predicted from the sequence, allowing for high-throughput annotations, they consider only the sequence and its predicted secondary structure. We propose a novel sequence-based predictor, PFR-AF, which utilizes solvent accessibility and residue flexibility predicted from the sequence, to improve predictions and provide insights into the folding process. The predictor includes three linear regressions for proteins with two-state, multistate, and unknown (mixed-state) folding kinetics. PFR-AF on average outperforms current methods when tested on three datasets. The proposed approach provides high-quality predictions in the absence of similarity between the predicted and the training sequences. The PFR-AF's predictions are characterized by high (between 0.71 and 0.95, depending on the dataset) correlation and the lowest (between 0.75 and 0.9) mean absolute errors with respect to the experimental rates, as measured using out-of-sample tests. Our models reveal that for the two-state chains inclusion of solvent-exposed Ala may accelerate the folding, while increased content of Ile may reduce the folding speed. We also demonstrate that increased flexibility of coils facilitates faster folding and that proteins with larger content of solvent-exposed strands may fold at a slower pace. The increased flexibility of the solvent-exposed residues is shown to elongate folding, which also holds, with a lower correlation, for buried residues. Two case studies are included to support our findings.},

Instead of working on the conventional bit by bit operation, both the crossover and mutation operators are real-valued handled by the presented algorithms. To prevent the system from turning into a premature problem, we select the elitists from two groups of possible solutions to reproduce the new populations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithms, two simple functions are first tested. The results show that our method outperforms the conventional one no matter whether from the viewpoint of the number of iterations required to find the optimum solutions or from the final solutions obtained. The real-valued genetic algorithms are then exploited to optimize the fuzzy controller which is designed to perform the compensation job. Two different types of fuzzy inference rules are considered to compensate for the predicted errors from the grey model. The difficulty encountered in applying the genetic algorithms to adjusting the fuzzy parameters is also discussed. Based on the simulation results from the problems of the weather forecast, we found that the proposed methodology is very effective in determining the quantity of compensation for the predicted outputs from the traditional grey approach.

abstract = {The hypothesis that folding robustness is the primary determinant of the evolution rate of proteins is explored using a coarse-grained off-lattice model. The simplicity of the model allows rapid computation of the folding probability of a sequence to any folded conformation. For each robust folder, the network of sequences that share its native structure is identified. The fitness of a sequence is postulated to be a simple function of the number of misfolded molecules that have to be produced to reach a characteristic protein abundance. After fixation probabilities of mutants are computed under a simple population dynamics model, a Markov chain on the fold network is constructed, and the fold-averaged evolution rate is computed. The distribution of the logarithm of the evolution rates across distinct networks exhibits a peak with a long tail on the low rate side and resembles the universal empirical distribution of the evolutionary rates more closely than either distribution resembles the log-normal distribution. The results suggest that the universal distribution of the evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes is a direct consequence of the basic physics of protein folding.},

abstract = {Background: The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (telomorph Gibberella zeae) is the causal agent of several destructive crop diseases, where a set of genes usually work in concert to cause diseases to crops. To function appropriately, the F. graminearum proteins inside one cell should be assigned to different compartments, i.e. subcellular localizations. Therefore, the subcellular localizations of F. graminearum proteins can provide insights into protein functions and pathogenic mechanisms of this destructive pathogen fungus. Unfortunately, there are no subcellular localization information for F. graminearum proteins available now. Computational approaches provide an alternative way to predicting F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations due to the expensive and time-consuming biological experiments in lab. Results: In this paper, we developed a novel predictor, namely FGsub, to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations from the primary structures. First, a non-redundant fungi data set with subcellular localization annotation is collected from UniProtKB database and used as training set, where the subcellular locations are classified into 10 groups. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on the training set and used to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations for those proteins that do not have significant sequence similarity to those in training set. The performance of SVMs on training set with 10-fold cross-validation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, for F. graminearum proteins that have significant sequence similarity to those in training set, BLAST is utilized to transfer annotations of homologous proteins to uncharacterized F. graminearum proteins so that the F. graminearum proteins are annotated more comprehensively. Conclusions: In this work, we present FGsub to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations in a comprehensive manner. We make four fold contributions to this filed. First, we present a new algorithm to cope with imbalance problem that arises in protein subcellular localization prediction, which can solve imbalance problem and avoid false positive results. Second, we design an ensemble classifier which employs feature selection to further improve prediction accuracy. Third, we use BLAST to complement machine learning based methods, which enlarges our prediction coverage. Last and most important, we predict the subcellular localizations of 12786 F. graminearum proteins, which provide insights into protein functions and pathogenic mechanisms of this destructive pathogen fungus.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular localization is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins have multi-label features meaning that they may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing methods can only be used to deal with the single-label proteins. Actually, multi-label proteins should not be ignored because they usually bear some special function worthy of in-depth studies. By introducing the "multi-label learning" approach, a new predictor, called iLoc-Animal, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multi-label animal (metazoan except human) proteins. Meanwhile, to measure the prediction quality of a multi-label system in a rigorous way, five indices were introduced; they are "Absolute-True", "Absolute-False" (or Hamming-Loss"), "Accuracy", "Precision", and "Recall". As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Animal on a benchmark dataset of animal proteins classified into the following 20 location sites: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) centriole, (4) centrosome, (5) cell cortex, (6) cytoplasm, (7) cytoskeleton, (8) endoplasmic reticulum, (9) endosome, (10) extracellular, (11) Golgi apparatus, (12) lysosome, (13) mitochondrion, (14) melanosome, (15) microsome, (16) nucleus, (17) peroxisome, (18) plasma membrane, (19) spindle, and (20) synapse, where many proteins belong to two or more locations. For such a complicated system, the outcomes achieved by iLoc-Animal for all the aforementioned five indices were quite encouraging, indicating that the predictor may become a useful tool in this area. It has not escaped our notice that the multi-label approach and the rigorous measurement metrics can also be used to investigate many other multi-label problems in molecular biology. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Animal is freely accessible to the public at the web-site .},

abstract = {The membrane proteins make up more than a third of all known human proteins. The subcellular localizations play a key role to elucidate the potential biological functions of these membrane proteins. Although the experimental approaches for determining protein subcellular localizations exist, they are usually costly and time consuming. Thus, computational predictions provided an alternative approach for determining the protein subcellular localizations. However, current subcellular location predictors are generally developed for globular proteins. They did not perform well for membrane proteins. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction algorithm, namely Projected Gene Ontology Score, which introduces the Gene Ontology annotation as a descriptor of the protein. This algorithm could significantly improve the prediction accuracy for the subcellular localizations of membrane proteins. It can designate each protein to one of the eight different locations, while the existing algorithm only covers three locations. Actually, the biological problem considered by our algorithm goes one level deeper than the existing algorithms. In addition, our algorithm can provide more than one location for the testing protein, which could be very useful in practical studies. Our algorithm is expected to be a good complement to the existing algorithms and has the potential to be extended to solve other problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUD: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays important roles on gene regulation. Study of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing brings the availability of DNA methylation at single CpG resolution. The main interest of study on DNA methylation data is to test the methylation difference under two conditions of biological samples. However, the high cost and complexity of this sequencing experiment limits the number of biological replicates, which brings challenges to the development of statistical methods. RESULTS: Bayesian modeling is well known to be able to borrow strength across the genome, and hence is a powerful tool for high-dimensional-low-sample-size data. In order to provide accurate identification of methylation loci, especially for low coverage data, we propose a full Bayesian partition model to detect differentially methylated loci under two conditions of scientific study. Since hypo-methylation and hyper-methylation have distinct biological implication, it is desirable to differentiate these two types of differential methylation. The advantage of our Bayesian model is that it can produce one-step output of each locus being either equal-, hypo- or hyper-methylated locus without further post-hoc analysis. An R package named as MethyBayes implementing the proposed full Bayesian partition model will be submitted to the bioconductor website upon publication of the manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed full Bayesian partition model outperforms existing methods in terms of power while maintaining a low false discovery rate based on simulation studies and real data analysis including bioinformatics analysis.},

We introduce self-ensembling, where we form a consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the network-in-training on different epochs, and most importantly, under different regularization and input augmentation conditions. This ensemble prediction can be expected to be a better predictor for the unknown labels than the output of the network at the most recent training epoch, and can thus be used as a target for training. Using our method, we set new records for two standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, reducing the (non-augmented) classification error rate from 18.44{\%} to 7.05{\%} in SVHN with 500 labels and from 18.63{\%} to 16.55{\%} in CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, and further to 5.12{\%} and 12.16{\%} by enabling the standard augmentations. We additionally obtain a clear improvement in CIFAR-100 classification accuracy by using random images from the Tiny Images dataset as unlabeled extra inputs during training.

Identifying variants that disrupt TF binding and lead to human diseases remains a great challenge. To address this, we implement sequence-based deep learning models that accurately predict the TF binding intensities to given DNA sequences. In addition to accurately classifying TF-DNA binding or unbinding, our models are capable of accurately predicting real-valued TF binding intensities by leveraging large-scale TF ChIP-seq data. The changes in the TF binding intensities between the altered sequence and the reference sequence reflect the degree of functional impact for the variant. This enables us to develop the tool DeFine (Deep learning based Functional impact of non-coding variants evaluator, http://define.cbi.pku.edu.cn) with improved performance for assessing the functional impact of non-coding variants including SNPs and indels. DeFine accurately identifies the causal functional non-coding variants from disease-associated variants in GWAS. DeFine is an effective and easy-to-use tool that facilities systematic prioritization of functional non-coding variants.},

However, recent attempts to find effective substitutes to combat infections have been directed at identifying natural antimicrobial peptides in order to circumvent resistance to commercial antibiotics. This study describes the development of synthetic peptides with antimicrobial activity, created in silico by site-directed mutation modeling using wild-type peptides as scaffolds for these mutations. Fragments of antimicrobial peptides were used for modeling with molecular modeling computational tools. To analyze these peptides, a decision tree model, which indicated the action range of peptides on the types of microorganisms on which they can exercise biological activity, was created. The decision tree model was processed using physicochemistry properties from known antimicrobial peptides available at the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD). The two most promising peptides were synthesized, and antimicrobial assays showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Colossomin C and colossomin D were the most inhibitory peptides at 5 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The methods described in this work and the results obtained are useful for the identification and development of new compounds with antimicrobial activity through the use of computational tools.},

abstract = {Protein secretion is an important biological process for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Several sequence-based methods mainly rely on utilizing various types of complementary features to design accurate classifiers for predicting non-classical secretory proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) terms are increasing informative in predicting protein functions. However, the number of used GO terms is often very large. For example, there are 60,020 GO terms used in the prediction method Euk-mPLoc 2.0 for subcellular localization. This study proposes a novel approach to identify a small set of m top-ranked GO terms served as the only type of input features to design a support vector machine (SVM) based method Sec-GO to predict non-classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. To evaluate the Sec-GO method, two existing methods and their used datasets are adopted for performance comparisons. The Sec-GO method using m=436 GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of 96.7{\%} on mammalian proteins, much better than the existing method SPRED (82.2{\%}) which uses frequencies of tri-peptides and short peptides, secondary structure, and physicochemical properties as input features of a random forest classifier. Furthermore, when applying to Gram-positive bacterial proteins, the Sec-GO with m=158 GO terms has a test accuracy of 94.5{\%}, superior to NClassG+ (90.0{\%}) which uses SVM with several feature types, comprising amino acid composition, di-peptides, physicochemical properties and the position specific weighting matrix. Analysis of the distribution of secretory proteins in a GO database indicates the percentage of the non-classical secretory proteins annotated by GO is larger than that of classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Of the m top-ranked GO features, the top-four GO terms are all annotated by such subcellular locations as GO:0005576 (Extracellular region). Additionally, the method Sec-GO is easily implemented and its web tool of prediction is available at iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/secgo.},

The activities of the complexes are regulated by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs).

As the complexes perform crucial and diverse functions, these are important drug targets for tumour and stem cell therapeutic interventions. However, CDKIs are represented by proteins with considerable sequence heterogeneity and may fail to be identified by simple similarity search methods. In this work we have evaluated and developed machine learning methods for identification of CDKIs. We used different compositional features and evolutionary information in the form of PSSMs, from CDKIs and non-CDKIs for generating SVM and ANN classifiers. In the first stage, both the ANN and SVM models were evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and in the second stage these were tested on independent data sets. The PSSM-based SVM model emerged as the best classifier in both the stages and is publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/cdkipred.},

abstract = {Directly applying single-label classification methods to the multi-label learning problems substantially limits both the performance and speed due to the imbalance, dependence and high dimensionality of the given label matrix. Existing methods either ignore these three problems or reduce one with the price of aggravating another. In this paper, we propose a {\{}0,1{\}} label matrix compression and recovery method termed "compressed labeling (CL)" to simultaneously solve or at least reduce these three problems. CL first compresses the original label matrix to improve balance and independence by preserving the signs of its Gaussian random projections. Afterward, we directly utilize popular binary classification methods (e.g., support vector machines) for each new label. A fast recovery algorithm is developed to recover the original labels from the predicted new labels. In the recovery algorithm, a "labelset distilling method" is designed to extract distilled labelsets (DLs), i.e., the frequently appeared label subsets from the original labels via recursive clustering and subtraction. Given a distilled and an original label vector, we discover that the signs of their random projections have an explicit joint distribution that can be quickly computed from a geometric inference. Based on this observation, the original label vector is exactly determined after performing a series of Kullback-Leibler divergence based hypothesis tests on the distribution about the new labels. CL significantly improves the balance of the training samples and reduces the dependence between different labels. Moreover, it accelerates the learning process by training fewer binary classifiers for compressed labels, and makes use of label dependence via DLs based tests. Theoretically, we prove the recovery bounds of CL which verifies the effectiveness of CL for label compression and multi-label classification performance improvement brought by label correlations preserved in DLs. We show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of CL via 5 groups of experiments on 21 datasets from text classification, image annotation, scene classification, music categorization, genomics and web page classification.},

abstract = {Summary: As one of the most important tasks in protein sequence analysis, protein remote homology detection is critical for both basic research and practical applications. Here, we present an effective web server for protein remote homology detection called ProtDec-LTR2.0 by combining ProtDec-Learning to Rank (LTR) and pseudo protein representation. Experimental results showed that the detection performance is obviously improved. The web server provides a user-friendly interface to explore the sequence and structure information of candidate proteins and find their conserved domains by launching a multiple sequence alignment tool.

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) enable innovative applications of machine learning like image recognition, machine translation, or malware detection. However, deep learning is often criticized for its lack of robustness in adversarial settings (e.g., vulnerability to adversarial inputs) and general inability to rationalize its predictions. In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions. We evaluate the DkNN algorithm on several datasets, and show the confidence estimates accurately identify inputs outside the model, and that the explanations provided by nearest neighbors are intuitive and useful in understanding model failures.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important yet challenging problem. Recently, several computational methods based on Gene Ontology (GO) have been proposed to tackle this problem and have demonstrated superiority over methods based on other features. Existing GO-based methods, however, do not fully use the GO information. This paper proposes an efficient GO method called GOASVM that exploits the information from the GO term frequencies and distant homologs to represent a protein in the general form of Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition. The method first selects a subset of relevant GO terms to form a GO vector space. Then for each protein, the method uses the accession number (AC) of the protein or the ACs of its homologs to find the number of occurrences of the selected GO terms in the Gene Ontology annotation (GOA) database as a means to construct GO vectors for support vector machines (SVMs) classification. With the advantages of GO term frequencies and a new strategy to incorporate useful homologous information, GOASVM can achieve a prediction accuracy of 72.2{\%} on a new independent test set comprising novel proteins that were added to Swiss-Prot six years later than the creation date of the training set. GOASVM and Supplementary materials are available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/mGoaSvmServer/GOASVM.html.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Enhancers are of short regulatory DNA elements. They can be bound with proteins (activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a critical role in promoting gene transcription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is a challenging task to develop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely complicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, they were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an enhancer or not. According to the distinct levels of biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes, however, enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength. RESULTS: In view of this, a two-layer predictor called ' IENHANCER-2L: ' was proposed by formulating DNA elements with the 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', into which the six DNA local parameters were incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated that IENHANCER-2L: holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for the two-layer predictor was established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

@article{Chang2010,
abstract = {Folding rate prediction is a useful way to find the key factors affecting folding kinetics of proteins. Structural information is more or less required in the present prediction methods, which limits the application of these methods to various proteins. In this work, an "effective length" is defined solely based on the composition of a protein, namely, the number of specific types of amino acids in a protein. A physical theory based on a minimalist model is employed to describe the relation between the folding rates and the effective length of proteins. Based on the resultant relationship between folding rates and effective length, the optimal sets of amino acids are found through the enumeration over all possible combinations of amino acids. This optimal set achieves a high correlation (with the coefficient of 0.84) between the folding rates and the optimal effective length. The features of these amino acids are consistent with our model and landscape theory. Further comparisons between our effective length and other factors are carried out. The effective length is physically consistent with structure-based prediction methods and has the best predictability for folding rates. These results all suggest that both entropy and energetics contribute importantly to folding kinetics. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict folding rates from composition enables the analysis of the kinetics for various kinds of proteins. The underlying physics in our method may be helpful to stimulate further understanding on the effects of various amino acids in folding dynamics.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular locations has attracted much attention in the past decade. However, one of the most challenging problems is that many proteins were found simultaneously existing in, or moving between, two or more different cell components in a eukaryotic cell. Seldom previous predictors were able to deal with such multiplex proteins although they have extremely important implications in future drug discovery in terms of their specific subcellular targeting. Approximately 20{\%} of the human proteome consists of such multiplex proteins with multiple sample labels. In order to efficiently handle such multiplex human proteins, we have developed a novel multi-label (ML) learning and prediction framework called ML-PLoc, which decomposes the multi-label prediction problem into multiple independent binary classification problems. ML-PLoc is constructed based on support vector machine (SVM) and sequential evolution information. Experimental results show that ML-PLoc can achieve an overall accuracy 64.6{\%} and recall ratio 67.2{\%} on a benchmark dataset consisting of 14 human subcellular locations, and is very powerful for dealing with multiplex proteins. The current approach represents a new strategy to deal with the multi-label biological problems.

abstract = {Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Because the underlying mechanisms associated with miRNA binding to mRNA are not fully understood, a major challenge of miRNA studies involves the identification of miRNA-target sites on mRNA. In silico prediction of miRNA-target sites can expedite costly and time-consuming experimental work by providing the most promising miRNA-target-site candidates. Results: In this study, we reported the design and implementation of DeepMirTar, a deep-learning-based approach for accurately predicting human miRNA targets at the site level. The predicted miRNA-target sites are those having canonical or non-canonical seed, and features, including high-level expert-designed, low-level expert-designed and raw-data-level, were used to represent the miRNA-target site. Comparison with other state-of-the-art machine-learning methods and existing miRNA-target-prediction tools indicated that DeepMirTar improved overall predictive performance.

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial role in transcription and gene-regulation. This paper describes a support vector machine (SVM) based method for discriminating and classifying RNA-binding and non-binding proteins using sequence features. With the threshold of 30{\%} interacting residues, RNA-binding amino acid prediction method PPRINT achieved the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.32. BLAST and PSI-BLAST identified RBPs with the coverage of 32.63 and 33.16{\%}, respectively, at the e-value of 1e-4. The SVM models developed with amino acid, dipeptide and four-part amino acid compositions showed the MCC of 0.60, 0.46, and 0.53, respectively. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile has been successfully used for predicting RBPs. We achieved the maximum MCC of 0.62 using SVM model based on PSSM called PSSM-400. Finally, we developed different hybrid approaches and achieved maximum MCC of 0.66. We also developed a method for predicting three subclasses of RNA binding proteins (e. g., rRNA, tRNA, mRNA binding proteins). The performance of the method was also evaluated on an independent dataset of 69 RBPs and 100 non-RBPs (NBPs). An additional benchmarking was also performed using gene ontology (GO) based annotation. Based on the hybrid approach a web-server RNApred has been developed for predicting RNA binding proteins from amino acid sequences (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/rnapred/).

abstract = {An algorithm for the identification of possible binding sites of biomolecules, which are represented as regions of the molecular surface, is introduced. The algorithm is based on the segmentation of the molecular surface into overlapping patches as described in the first article of this series.1 The properties of these patches (calculated on the basis of physical and chemical properties) are used for the analysis of the molecular surfaces of 7821 proteins and protein complexes. Special attention is drawn to known protein binding sites. A binding site identification algorithm is realized on the basis of the calculated data using a neural network strategy. The neural network is able to classify surface patches as protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-ligand, or nonbinding sites. To show the capability of the algorithm, results of the surface analysis and the predictions are presented and discussed with representative examples.},

abstract = {The ability to predict protein folding rates constitutes an important step in understanding the overall folding mechanisms. Although many of the prediction methods are structure based, successful predictions can also be obtained from the sequence. We developed a novel method called prediction of protein folding rates (PPFR), for the prediction of protein folding rates from protein sequences. PPFR implements a linear regression model for each of the mainstream folding dynamics including two-, multi-, and mixed-state proteins. The proposed method provides predictions characterized by strong correlations with the experimental folding rates, which equal 0.87 for the two- and multistate proteins and 0.82 for the mixed-state proteins, when evaluated with out-of-sample jackknife test. Based on in-sample and out-of-sample tests, the PPFR's predictions are shown to be better than most of other sequence only and structure-based predictors and complementary to the predictions of the most recent sequence-based QRSM method. We show that simultaneous incorporation of several characteristics, including the sequence, physiochemical properties of residues, and predicted secondary structure provides improved quality. This hybridized prediction model was analyzed to reveal the complementary factors that can be used in tandem to predict folding rates. We show that bigger proteins require more time for folding, higher helical and coil content and the presence of Phe, Asn, and Gln may accelerate the folding process, the inclusion of Ile, Val, Thr, and Ser may slow down the folding process, and for the two-state proteins increased beta-strand content may decelerate the folding process. Finally, PPFR provides strong correlation when predicting sequences with low similarity.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Computational approaches to protein function prediction infer protein function by finding proteins with similar sequence, structure, surface clefts, chemical properties, amino acid motifs, interaction partners or phylogenetic profiles. We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs. RESULTS: Our graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.

@article{Niarchou2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides are a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Plants are an important source of such peptides; their pharmacological properties are known since antiquity. Access to relevant information, however, is not straightforward, as there are practically no major repositories of experimentally validated and/or predicted plant antimicrobial peptides. PhytAMP is the only database dedicated to plant peptides with confirmed antimicrobial action, holding 273 entries. Data on such peptides can be otherwise retrieved from generic repositories. DESCRIPTION: We present C-PAmP, a database of computationally predicted plant antimicrobial peptides. C-PAmP contains 15,174,905 peptides, 5-100 amino acids long, derived from 33,877 proteins of 2,112 plant species in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Its web interface allows queries based on peptide/protein sequence, protein accession number and species. Users can view the corresponding predicted peptides along with their probability score, their classification according to the Collection of Anti-Microbial Peptides (CAMP), and their PhytAMP id where applicable. Moreover, users can visualise protein regions with a high concentration of predicted antimicrobial peptides. In order to identify potential antimicrobial peptides we used a classification algorithm, based on a modified version of the pseudo amino acid concept. The classifier tested all subsequences ranging from 5 to 100 amino acids of the plant proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and stored those classified as antimicrobial with a high probability score ({\textgreater}90{\%}). Its performance measures across a 10-fold cross-validation are more than satisfactory (accuracy: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 0.90) and it succeeded in classifying 99.5{\%} of the PhytAMP peptides correctly. CONCLUSIONS: We have compiled a major repository of predicted plant antimicrobial peptides using a highly performing classification algorithm. Our repository is accessible from the web and supports multiple querying options to optimise data retrieval. We hope it will greatly benefit drug design research by significantly limiting the range of plant peptides to be experimentally tested for antimicrobial activity.},

abstract = {One of the most important challenges in computational and molecular biology is to understand the relationship between amino acid sequences and the folding rates of proteins. Recent works suggest that topological parameters, amino acid properties, chain length and the composition index relate well with protein folding rates, however, sequence order information has seldom been considered as a property for predicting protein folding rates. In this study, amino acid sequence order was used to derive an effective method, based on an extended version of the pseudo-amino acid composition, for predicting protein folding rates without any explicit structural information. Using the jackknife cross validation test, the method was demonstrated on the largest dataset (99 proteins) reported. The method was found to provide a good correlation between the predicted and experimental folding rates. The correlation coefficient is 0.81 (with a highly significant level) and the standard error is 2.46. The reported algorithm was found to perform better than several representative sequence-based approaches using the same dataset. The results indicate that sequence order information is an important determinant of protein folding rates.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also called host defense peptides, are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response and are found among all classes of life. According to their special functions, AMPs are generally classified into ten categories: Antibacterial Peptides, Anticancer/tumor Peptides, Antifungal Peptides, Anti-HIV Peptides, Antiviral Peptides, Antiparasital Peptides, Anti-protist Peptides, AMPs with Chemotactic Activity, Insecticidal Peptides, and Spermicidal Peptides. Given a query peptide, how can we identify whether it is an AMP or non-AMP? If it is, can we identify which functional type or types it belong to? Particularly, how can we deal with the multi-type problem since an AMP may belong to two or more functional types? To address these problems, which are obviously very important to both basic research and drug development, a multi-label classifier was developed based on the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm, where the components of PseAAC were featured by incorporating five physicochemical properties. The novel classifier is called iAMP-2L, where "2L" means that it is a 2-level predictor. The 1(st)-level is to answer the 1(st) question above, while the 2(nd)-level is to answer the 2(nd) and 3(rd) questions that are beyond the reach of any existing methods in this area. For the conveniences of users, a user-friendly web-server for iAMP-2L was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iAMP-2L.},

abstract = {Author Summary Searching a protein or DNA sequence database to find sequences that are evolutionarily related to a query is one of the foundational problems in computational biology. These database searches rely on pairwise comparisons of sequence similarity between the query and targets, but despite years of method refinements, pairwise comparisons still often fail to detect more distantly related targets. In this study, we adapt recent work from natural language processing to exploit the global structure of the data space in this detection problem. In particular, we borrow the idea of a semantic embedding, where by training on a large text data set, one learns an embedding of words into a low-dimensional semantic space such that words embedded close to each other are likely to be semantically related. We present the ProtEmbed algorithm, which learns an embedding of protein sequences into a semantic space where evolutionarily-related proteins are embedded in close proximity. The flexible training algorithm allows additional pieces of evidence, such as 3D structural information, to be incorporated in the learning process and enables ProtEmbed to achieve state-of-the-art performance for the task of detecting targets that have remote evolutionary relationships to the query.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the molecular details of protein-DNA interactions is critical for deciphering the mechanisms of gene regulation. We present a machine learning approach for the identification of amino acid residues involved in protein-DNA interactions. Results: We start with a Nave Bayes classifier trained to predict whether a given amino acid residue is a DNA- binding residue based on its identity and the identities of its sequence neighbors. The input to the classifier consists of the identities of the target residue and 4 sequence neighbors on each side of the target residue. The classifier is trained and evaluated (using leave-one-out cross-validation) on a non-redundant set of 171 proteins. Our results indicate the feasibility of identifying interface residues based on local sequence information. The classifier achieves 71{\%} overall accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.24, 35{\%} specificity and 53{\%} sensitivity in identifying interface residues as evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. We show that the performance of the classifier is improved by using sequence entropy of the target residue (the entropy of the corresponding column in multiple alignment obtained by aligning the target sequence with its sequence homologs) as additional input. The classifier achieves 78{\%} overall accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.28, 44{\%} specificity and 41{\%} sensitivity in identifying interface residues. Examination of the predictions in the context of 3-dimensional structures of proteins demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in identifying DNA-binding sites from sequence information. In 33{\%} (56 out of 171) of the proteins, the classifier identifies the interaction sites by correctly recognizing at least half of the interface residues. In 87{\%} (149 out of 171) of the proteins, the classifier correctly identifies at least 20{\%} of the interface residues. This suggests the possibility of using such classifiers to identify potential DNA- binding motifs and to gain potentially useful insights into sequence correlates of protein-DNA interactions. Conclusion: Naive Bayes classifiers trained to identify DNA-binding residues using sequence information offer a computationally efficient approach to identifying putative DNA- binding sites in DNA-binding proteins and recognizing potential DNA-binding motifs.},

abstract = {Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a rising concern among health care professionals, driving them to search for alternative therapies. In the past few years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted a lot of attention as a substitute for conventional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides have a broad spectrum of activity and can act as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and sometimes even as anticancer drugs. The antibacterial peptides have little sequence homology, despite common properties. Since there is a need to develop a computational method for predicting the antibacterial peptides, in the present study, we have applied the concept of Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and machine learning methods for their classification. Our results demonstrate that using the concept of PseAAC and applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) can provide useful information to predict antibacterial peptides.},

It is feasible to analyze genetic signals in amino acid sequences because there are already, a lot of mature information process systems. This paper makes use of similarity rule, complementarily rule, molecular recognition theory, and information theory to set up a model of digital coding for amino acids. The model reflects better amino acid chemical physical properties and degeneracy It transforms the symbolic DNA sequences into digital genetic signals of amino acids and offers the possibility to utilize Cellular Automata.

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a persistent problem in the public health sphere. However, recent attempts to find effective substitutes to combat infections have been directed at identifying natural antimicrobial peptides in order to circumvent resistance to commercial antibiotics. This study describes the development of synthetic peptides with antimicrobial activity, created in silico by site-directed mutation modeling using wild-type peptides as scaffolds for these mutations. Fragments of antimicrobial peptides were used for modeling with molecular modeling computational tools. To analyze these peptides, a decision tree model, which indicated the action range of peptides on the types of microorganisms on which they can exercise biological activity, was created. The decision tree model was processed using physicochemistry properties from known antimicrobial peptides available at the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD). The two most promising peptides were synthesized, and antimicrobial assays showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Colossomin C and colossomin D were the most inhibitory peptides at 5 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The methods described in this work and the results obtained are useful for the identification and development of new compounds with antimicrobial activity through the use of computational tools.},

The comparison between the prediction results and the measured data demonstrates that,the prediction is an extent of variable force rather than a certain point for the given turning conditions, and that the measured force drops into the extent with a smaller relative error.

abstract = {Kernel-based learning algorithms work by embedding the data into a Euclidean space, and then searching for linear relations among the embedded data points. The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space-classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm- using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.},

@article{Parras-Molto2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most proteins have evolved in specific cellular compartments that limit their functions and potential interactions. On the other hand, motifs define amino acid arrangements conserved between protein family members and represent powerful tools for assigning function to protein sequences. The ideal motif would identify all members of a protein family but in practice many motifs identify both family members and unrelated proteins, referred to as True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) sequences, respectively. RESULTS: To address the relationship between protein motifs, protein function and cellular localization, we systematically assigned subcellular localization data to motif sequences from the comprehensive PROSITE sequence motif database. Using this data we analyzed relationships between localization and function. We find that TPs and FPs have a strong tendency to localize in different compartments. When multiple localizations are considered, TPs are usually distributed between related cellular compartments. We also identified cases where FPs are concentrated in particular subcellular regions, indicating possible functional or evolutionary relationships with TP sequences of the same motif. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the systematic examination of subcellular localization has the potential to uncover evolutionary and functional relationships between motif-containing sequences. We believe that this type of analysis complements existing motif annotations and could aid in their interpretation. Our results shed light on the evolution of cellular organelles and potentially establish the basis for new subcellular localization and function prediction algorithms.},

abstract = {Folding rate prediction is a useful way to find the key factors affecting folding kinetics of proteins. Structural information is more or less required in the present prediction methods, which limits the application of these methods to various proteins. In this work, an "effective length" is defined solely based on the composition of a protein, namely, the number of specific types of amino acids in a protein. A physical theory based on a minimalist model is employed to describe the relation between the folding rates and the effective length of proteins. Based on the resultant relationship between folding rates and effective length, the optimal sets of amino acids are found through the enumeration over all possible combinations of amino acids. This optimal set achieves a high correlation (with the coefficient of 0.84) between the folding rates and the optimal effective length. The features of these amino acids are consistent with our model and landscape theory. Further comparisons between our effective length and other factors are carried out. The effective length is physically consistent with structure-based prediction methods and has the best predictability for folding rates. These results all suggest that both entropy and energetics contribute importantly to folding kinetics. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict folding rates from composition enables the analysis of the kinetics for various kinds of proteins. The underlying physics in our method may be helpful to stimulate further understanding on the effects of various amino acids in folding dynamics.},

@article{Lee2006,
abstract = {Subcellular localization is one of the key functional characteristics of proteins. An automatic and efficient prediction method for the protein subcellular localization is highly required owing to the need for large-scale genome analysis. From a machine learning point of view, a dataset of protein localization has several characteristics: the dataset has too many classes (there are more than 10 localizations in a cell), it is a multi-label dataset (a protein may occur in several different subcellular locations), and it is too imbalanced (the number of proteins in each localization is remarkably different). Even though many previous works have been done for the prediction of protein subcellular localization, none of them tackles effectively these characteristics at the same time. Thus, a new computational method for protein localization is eventually needed for more reliable outcomes. To address the issue, we present a protein localization predictor based on D-SVDD (PLPD) for the prediction of protein localization, which can find the likelihood of a specific localization of a protein more easily and more correctly. Moreover, we introduce three measurements for the more precise evaluation of a protein localization predictor. As the results of various datasets which are made from the experiments of Huh et al. (2003), the proposed PLPD method represents a different approach that might play a complimentary role to the existing methods, such as Nearest Neighbor method and discriminate covariant method. Finally, after finding a good boundary for each localization using the 5184 classified proteins as training data, we predicted 138 proteins whose subcellular localizations could not be clearly observed by the experiments of Huh et al. (2003).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein-DNA interactions are essential for fundamental biological activities including DNA transcription, replication, packaging, repair and rearrangement. Proteins interacting with DNA can be classified into two categories of binding mechanisms - sequence-specific and non-specific binding. Protein-DNA specific binding provides a mechanism to recognize correct nucleotide base pairs for sequence-specific identification. Protein-DNA non-specific binding shows sequence independent interaction for accelerated targeting by interacting with DNA backbone. Both sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues contribute to their roles for interaction. RESULTS: The proposed framework has two stage predictors: DNA-binding residues prediction and binding mode prediction. In the first stage - DNA-binding residues prediction, the predictor for DNA specific binding residues achieves 96.45{\%} accuracy with 50.14{\%} sensitivity, 99.31{\%} specificity, 81.70{\%} precision, and 62.15{\%} F-measure. The predictor for DNA non-specific binding residues achieves 89.14{\%} accuracy with 53.06{\%} sensitivity, 95.25{\%} specificity, 65.47{\%} precision, and 58.62{\%} F-measure. While combining prediction results of sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues with OR operation, the predictor achieves 89.26{\%} accuracy with 56.86{\%} sensitivity, 95.63{\%} specificity, 71.92{\%} precision, and 63.51{\%} F-measure. In the second stage, protein-DNA binding mode prediction achieves 75.83{\%} accuracy while using support vector machine with multi-class prediction. CONCLUSION: This article presents the design of a sequence based predictor aiming to identify sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues in a transcription factor with DNA binding-mechanism concerned. The protein-DNA binding mode prediction was introduced to help improve DNA-binding residues prediction. In addition, the results of this study will help with the design of binding-mechanism concerned predictors for other families of proteins interacting with DNA.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Owing to its importance in both basic research (such as molecular evolution and protein attribute prediction) and practical application (such as timely modeling the 3D structures of proteins targeted for drug development), protein remote homology detection has attracted a great deal of interest. It is intriguing to note that the profile-based approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard. To further improve protein remote homology detection, a key step is how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary information into the profiles. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel approach, the so-called profile-based protein representation, to extract the evolutionary information via the frequency profiles. The latter can be calculated from the multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST. Three top performing sequence-based kernels (SVM-Ngram, SVM-pairwise and SVM-LA) were combined with the profile-based protein representation. Various tests were conducted on a SCOP benchmark dataset that contains 54 families and 23 superfamilies. The results showed that the new approach is promising, and can obviously improve the performance of the three kernels. Furthermore, our approach can also provide useful insights for studying the features of proteins in various families. It has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be easily combined with the existing sequence-based methods so as to improve their performance as well.

Several popular multi-label learning algorithms and feature extraction methods were tested on a comprehensive, up-to-date AMP dataset with twelve biological activities covered and its filtered version with five activities covered.

Facing the avalanche of new protein sequences discovered in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop automated methods for quickly and accurately predicting the location sites of viral proteins in a host cell; the information thus acquired is particularly important for medical science and antiviral drug design. In view of this, a new fusion classifier called "Virus-mPLoc" was established by hybridizing the gene ontology information, functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information. The new predictor not only can more accurately predict the location sites of viral proteins in a host cell, but also have the capacity to identify the multiple-location virus proteins, which is beyond the reach of any existing predictors specialized for viral proteins.

In contrast, unfolding rates are thought to depend on sequence specifics and be much more difficult to predict. Here we introduce a minimalist physics-based model that computes one-dimensional folding free energy surfaces using the number of aminoacids (N) and the structural class (alpha-helical, all-beta, or alpha-beta) as only protein-specific input. In this model N sets the overall cost in conformational entropy and the net stabilization energy, whereas the structural class defines the partitioning of the stabilization energy between local and non-local interactions. To test its predictive power, we calibrated the model empirically and implemented it into an algorithm for the PREdiction of Folding and Unfolding Rates (PREFUR). We found that PREFUR predicts the absolute folding and unfolding rates of an experimental database of 52 proteins with accuracies of +/-0.7 and +/-1.4 orders of magnitude, respectively (relative to experimental spans of 6 and 8 orders of magnitude). Such prediction uncertainty for proteins vastly varying in size and structure is only two-fold larger than the differences in folding (+/-0.34) and unfolding rates (+/-0.7) caused by single-point mutations. Moreover, PREFUR predicts protein stability with an accuracy of +/-6.3 kJ mol(-1), relative to the 5 kJ mol(-1) average perturbation induced by single-point mutations. The remarkable performance of our simplistic model demonstrates that size and structural class are the major determinants of the folding landscapes of natural proteins, whereas sequence variability only provides the final 10-20{\%} tuning. PREFUR is thus a powerful bioinformatic tool for the prediction of folding properties and analysis of experimental data.},

@article{Grahnen2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein sequence evolution is constrained by the biophysics of folding and function, causing interdependence between interacting sites in the sequence. However, current site-independent models of sequence evolutions do not take this into account. Recent attempts to integrate the influence of structure and biophysics into phylogenetic models via statistical/informational approaches have not resulted in expected improvements in model performance. This suggests that further innovations are needed for progress in this field. RESULTS: Here we develop a coarse-grained physics-based model of protein folding and binding function, and compare it to a popular informational model. We find that both models violate the assumption of the native sequence being close to a thermodynamic optimum, causing directional selection away from the native state. Sampling and simulation show that the physics-based model is more specific for fold-defining interactions that vary less among residue type. The informational model diffuses further in sequence space with fewer barriers and tends to provide less support for an invariant sites model, although amino acid substitutions are generally conservative. Both approaches produce sequences with natural features like dN/dS {\textless} 1 and gamma-distributed rates across sites. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coarse-grained models of protein folding can describe some natural features of evolving proteins but are currently not accurate enough to use in evolutionary inference. This is partly due to improper packing of the hydrophobic core. We suggest possible improvements on the representation of structure, folding energy, and binding function, as regards both native and non-native conformations, and describe a large number of possible applications for such a model.},

abstract = {Although numerous efforts have been made for predicting the subcellular locations of proteins based on their sequence information, it still remains as a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins may have the multiplex character, i.e., they simultaneously exist, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing methods were established on the assumption: a protein has one, and only one, subcellular location. Actually, recent evidence has indicated an increasing number of human proteins having multiple subcellular locations. This kind of multiplex proteins should not be ignored because they may bear some special biological functions worthy of our attention. Based on the accumulation-label scale, a new predictor, called iLoc-Hum, was developed for identifying the subcellular localization of human proteins with both single and multiple location sites. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Hum on a benchmark dataset of human proteins that covers the following 14 location sites: centrosome, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, endosome, extracellular, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, microsome, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, and synapse, where some proteins belong to two, three or four locations but none has 25{\%} or higher pairwise sequence identity to any other in the same subset. For such a complicated and stringent system, the overall success rate achieved by iLoc-Hum was 76{\%}, which is remarkably higher than that by any of the existing predictors that also have the capacity to deal with this kind of system. Further comparisons were also made via two independent datasets; all indicated that the success rates by iLoc-Hum were even more significantly higher than its counterparts. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Hum is freely accessible to the public at or . For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results by choosing either a straightforward submission or a batch submission, without the need to follow the complicated mathematical equations involved.},

abstract = {Biases in observational data of treatments pose a major challenge to estimating expected treatment outcomes in different populations. An important technique that accounts for these biases is reweighting samples to minimize the discrepancy between treatment groups. We present a novel reweighting approach that uses bi-level optimization to alternately train a discriminator to minimize classification error, and a balancing weights generator that uses exponentiated gradient descent to maximize this error. This approach borrows principles from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to exploit the power of classifiers for measuring two-sample divergence. We provide theoretical results for conditions in which the estimation error is bounded by two factors: (i) the discrepancy measure induced by the discriminator; and (ii) the weights variability. Experimental results on several benchmarks comparing to previous state-of-the-art reweighting methods demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in estimating causal effects.},

The knowledge thus obtained can help us timely utilize these newly found protein sequences for both basic research and drug discovery. Many bioinformatics tools have been developed by means of machine learning methods. This review is focused on the applications of a new kind of science (cellular automata) in protein bioinformatics. A cellular automaton (CA) is an open, flexible and discrete dynamic model that holds enormous potentials in modeling complex systems, in spite of the simplicity of the model itself. Researchers, scientists and practitioners from different fields have utilized cellular automata for visualizing protein sequences, investigating their evolution processes, and predicting their various attributes. Owing to its impressive power, intuitiveness and relative simplicity, the CA approach has great potential for use as a tool for bioinformatics.},

abstract = {Using the pseudo amino acid (PseAA) composition to represent the sample of a protein can incorporate a considerable amount of sequence pattern information so as to improve the prediction quality for its structural or functional classification. However, how to optimally formulate the PseAA composition is an important problem yet to be solved. In this article the grey modeling approach is introduced that is particularly efficient in coping with complicated systems such as the one consisting of many proteins with different sequence orders and lengths. On the basis of the grey model, four coefficients derived from each of the protein sequences concerned are adopted for its PseAA components. The PseAA composition thus formulated is called the "grey-PseAA" composition that can catch the essence of a protein sequence and better reflect its overall pattern. In our study we have demonstrated that introduction of the grey-PseAA composition can remarkably enhance the success rates in predicting the protein structural class. It is anticipated that the concept of grey-PseAA composition can be also used to predict many other protein attributes, such as subcellular localization, membrane protein type, enzyme functional class, GPCR type, protease type, among many others.},

abstract = {Motivation: A cell contains numerous protein molecules. One of the fundamental goals in cell biology is to determine their subcellular locations, which can provide useful clues about their functions. Knowledge of protein subcellular localization is also indispensable for prioritizing and selecting the right targets for drug development. With the avalanche of protein sequences emerging in the post-genomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational tools for timely and effectively identifying their subcellular localization based on the sequence information alone. Recently, a predictor called "pLoc-mAnimal" was developed for identifying the subcellular localization of animal proteins. Its performance is overwhelmingly better than that of the other predictors for the same purpose, particularly in dealing with the multi-label systems in which some proteins, called "multiplex proteins", may simultaneously occur in two or more subcellular locations. Although it is indeed a very powerful predictor, more efforts are definitely needed to further improve it. This is because pLoc-mAnimal was trained by an extremely skewed dataset in which some subset (subcellular location) was about 128 times the size of the other subsets. Accordingly, such an uneven training dataset will inevitably cause a biased consequence. Results: To alleviate such biased consequence, we have developed a new and bias-reducing predictor called pLoc{\_}bal-mAnimal by quasi-balancing the training dataset. Cross-validation tests on exactly the same experiment-confirmed dataset have indicated that the proposed new predictor is remarkably superior to pLoc-mAnimal, the existing state-of-the-art predictor, in identifying the subcellular localization of animal proteins. Availability: To maximize the convenience for the vast majority of experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for the new predictor has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pLoc{\_}bal-mAnimal/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematics.

In the present work, we develop a related measure, the geometric contact number, N (alpha), which is the number of nonlocal contacts that are well-packed, by a Voronoi criterion. We find, first, that in 80 proteins, the largest such database of proteins yet studied, N (alpha) is a consistently excellent predictor of folding speeds of both two-state fast folders and more complex multistate folders. Second, we show that folding rates can also be predicted from amino acid sequences directly, without the need to know the native topology or other structural properties.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein subcellular localization is pivotal in understanding a protein's function. Computational prediction of subcellular localization has become a viable alternative to experimental approaches. While current machine learning-based methods yield good prediction accuracy, most of them suffer from two key problems: lack of interpretability and dealing with multiple locations. Results: We present YLoc, a novel method for predicting protein subcellular localization that addresses these issues. Due to its simple architecture, YLoc can identify the relevant features of a protein sequence contributing to its subcellular localization, e.g. localization signals or motifs relevant to protein sorting. We present several example applications where YLoc identifies the sequence features responsible for protein localization, and thus reveals not only to which location a protein is transported to, but also why it is transported there. YLoc also provides a confidence estimate for the prediction. Thus, the user can decide what level of error is acceptable for a prediction. Due to a probabilistic approach and the use of several thousands of dual-targeted proteins, YLoc is able to predict multiple locations per protein. YLoc was benchmarked using several independent datasets for protein subcellular localization and performs on par with other state-of-the-art predictors. Disregarding low-confidence predictions, YLoc can achieve prediction accuracies of over 90{\%}. Moreover, we show that YLoc is able to reliably predict multiple locations and outperforms the best predictors in this area.},

abstract = {Proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Proteins with multiple locations or dynamic feature of this kind are particularly interesting because they may have some very special biological functions intriguing to investigators in both basic research and drug discovery. For instance, among the 6408 human protein entries that have experimentally observed subcellular location annotations in the Swiss-Prot database (version 50.7, released 19-Sept-2006), 973 ( approximately 15{\%}) have multiple location sites. The number of total human protein entries (except those annotated with "fragment" or those with less than 50 amino acids) in the same database is 14,370, meaning a gap of (14,370-6408)=7962 entries for which no knowledge is available about their subcellular locations. Although one can use the computational approach to predict the desired information for the gap, so far all the existing methods for predicting human protein subcellular localization are limited in the case of single location site only. To overcome such a barrier, a new ensemble classifier, named Hum-mPLoc, was developed that can be used to deal with the case of multiple location sites as well. Hum-mPLoc is freely accessible to the public as a web server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/hum-multi. Meanwhile, for the convenience of people working in the relevant areas, Hum-mPLoc has been used to identify all human protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results thus obtained have been deposited in a downloadable file prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab{\_}Hum-mPLoc.xls". This file is available at the same website and will be updated twice a year to include new entries of human proteins and reflect the continuous development of Hum-mPLoc.},

abstract = {Protein fold recognition is an important step towards understanding protein three-dimensional structures and their functions. A conditional graphical model, i.e., segmentation conditional random fields (SCRFs), is proposed as an effective solution to this problem. In contrast to traditional graphical models, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM), SCRFs follow a discriminative approach. Therefore, it is flexible to include any features in the model, such as overlapping or long-range interaction features over the whole sequence. The model also employs a convex optimization function, which results in globally optimal solutions to the model parameters. On the other hand, the segmentation setting in SCRFs makes their graphical structures intuitively similar to the protein 3-D structures and more importantly provides a framework to model the long-range interactions between secondary structures directly. Our model is applied to predict the parallel $\beta$-helix fold, an important fold in bacterial pathogenesis and carbohydrate binding/cleavage. The cross-family validation shows that SCRFs not only can score all known $\beta$-helices higher than non-$\beta$-helices in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but also accurately locates rungs in known beta-helix proteins. Our method outperforms BetaWrap, a state-of-the-art algorithm for predicting beta-helix folds, and HMMER, a general motif detection algorithm based on HMM, and has the additional advantage of general application to other protein folds. Applying our prediction model to the Uniprot Database, we identify previously unknown potential $\beta$-helices. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

The profiles of all protein sequences in the training set are constructed by PSI-BLAST, and the pairwise profile alignment scores are used to form feature vectors for training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. It was found that PairProSVM outperforms the methods that are based on sequence alignment and amino acid compositions even if most of the homologous sequences have been removed. PairProSVM was evaluated on Huang and Li's and Gardy et al.'s protein data sets. The overall accuracies on these data sets reach 75.3 percent and 91.9 percent, respectively, which are higher than or comparable to those obtained by sequence alignment and composition-based methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce a wide variety of extracellular signals to within the cell and therefore have a key role in regulating cell activity and physiological function. GPCR malfunction is responsible for a wide range of diseases including cancer, diabetes and hyperthyroidism and a large proportion of drugs on the market target these receptors. The three dimensional structure of GPCRs is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and for performing structure-based drug design. Although structural data are restricted to only a handful of GPCRs, homology models can be used as a proxy for those receptors not having crystal structures. However, many researchers working on GPCRs are not experienced homology modellers and are therefore unable to benefit from the information that can be gleaned from such three-dimensional models. Here, we present a comprehensive database called the GPCR-SSFE, which provides initial homology models of the transmembrane helices for a large variety of family A GPCRs. DESCRIPTION: Extending on our previous theoretical work, we have developed an automated pipeline for GPCR homology modelling and applied it to a large set of family A GPCR sequences. Our pipeline is a fragment-based approach that exploits available family A crystal structures. The GPCR-SSFE database stores the template predictions, sequence alignments, identified sequence and structure motifs and homology models for 5025 family A GPCRs. Users are able to browse the GPCR dataset according to their pharmacological classification or search for results using a UniProt entry name. It is also possible for a user to submit a GPCR sequence that is not contained in the database for analysis and homology model building. The models can be viewed using a Jmol applet and are also available for download along with the alignments. CONCLUSIONS: The data provided by GPCR-SSFE are useful for investigating general and detailed sequence-structure-function relationships of GPCRs, performing structure-based drug design and for better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-associated mutations in GPCRs. The effectiveness of our multiple template and fragment approach is demonstrated by the accuracy of our predicted homology models compared to recently published crystal structures.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequences and folding rates of proteins is an important task in computational and molecular biology. In this work, we have systematically analyzed the composition of amino acid residues for proteins with different ranges of folding rates. We observed that the polar residues, Asn, Gln, Ser, and Lys, are dominant in fast folding proteins whereas the hydrophobic residues, Ala, Cys, Gly, and Leu, prefer to be in slow folding proteins. Further, we have developed a method based on quadratic response surface models for predicting the folding rates of 77 two- and three-state proteins. Our method showed a correlation of 0.90 between experimental and predicted protein folding rates using leave-one-out cross-validation method. The classification of proteins based on structural class improved the correlation to 0.98 and it is 0.99, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively, for all-alpha, all-beta, and mixed class proteins. In addition, we have utilized Baysean classification theory for discriminating two- and three-state proteins, which showed an accuracy of 90{\%}.

abstract = {Preference learning is an emerging topic that appears in different guises in the recent literature. This work focuses on a particular learning scenario called label ranking, where the problem is to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a finite number of labels. Our approach for learning such a mapping, called ranking by pairwise comparison (RPC), first induces a binary preference relation from suitable training data using a natural extension of pairwise classification. A ranking is then derived from the preference relation thus obtained by means of a ranking procedure, whereby different ranking methods can be used for minimizing different loss functions. In particular, we show that a simple (weighted) voting strategy minimizes risk with respect to the well-known Spearman rank correlation. We compare RPC to existing label ranking methods, which are based on scoring individual labels instead of comparing pairs of labels. Both empirically and theoretically, it is shown that RPC is superior in terms of computational efficiency, and at least competitive in terms of accuracy.},

Aside from showing that consistency implies a specific form of localizability, we also show that consistency is logically equivalent to the combination of two properties: (1) a form of localizability, and (2) that the method's global mean (over the entire X distribution) correctly estimates the true mean. Consistency can therefore be seen as comprised of two aspects, one local and one global.},

abstract = {Protein subcellular localization aims at predicting the location of a protein within a cell using computational methods. Knowledge of subcellular localization of viral proteins in a host cell or virus-infected cell is important because it is closely related to their destructive tendencies and consequences. Prediction of viral protein subcellular localization is an important but challenging problem, particularly when proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing protein subcellular localization methods specialized for viral proteins are only used to deal with the single-location proteins. To better reflect the characteristics of multiplex proteins, a new predictor, called Virus-ECC-mPLoc, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both singleplex and multiplex proteins by introducing a powerful multi-label learning approach which exploits correlations between subcellular locations and by hybridizing the gene ontology information with the dipeptide composition information. It can be utilized to identify viral proteins among the following six locations: (1) viral capsid, (2) host cell membrane, (3) host endoplasmic reticulum, (4) host cytoplasm, (5) host nucleus, and (6) secreted. Experimental results show that the overall success rates thus obtained by Virus-ECC-mPLoc are 86.9{\%} for jackknife test and 87.2{\%} for independent data set test, which are significantly higher than that by any of the existing predictors. As a user-friendly web-server, Virus-ECCmPLoc is freely accessible to the public at the web-site http://levis.tongji.edu.cn:8080/bioinfo/Virus-ECC-mPLoc/.},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease prevalent in population and is not easily perceived in its initial stage but may sway a patient very seriously in later stage. In accordance with the estimation of World Health Organization (WHO), there will be 370 million diabetics which are 5.4{\%} of the global people in 2030, so it becomes more and more important to predict whether a pregnant woman has or is likely to acquire diabetes. This study is conducted with the use of the machine learning-Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)-to assist doctors in predicting pregnant women who have premonition of type 2 diabetes. AIRS is proposed by Andrew Watkins in 2001 and it makes use of the metaphor of the vertebrate immune system to recognize antigens, select clone, and memorize cells. Additionally, AIRS includes a mechanism, limited resource, to restrain the number of memory cells from increasing uncontrollably. It has also showed positive results on problems in which it was applied. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility in using AIRS to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) subsequent DM. The dataset of diabetes has imbalanced data, but the overall classification recall could still reach 62.8{\%}, which is better than the traditional method, logistic regression, and the technique which is thought as one of the powerful classification approaches, support vector machines (SVM).},

With the avalanche of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic age, to expedite the process of drug discovery, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method to rapidly identify GPCRs and their types. A new predictor was developed by hybridizing two different modes of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC): the functional domain PseAAC and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum PseAAC. The new predictor is called GPCR-2L, where "2L" means that it is a two-layer predictor: the 1st layer prediction engine is to identify a query protein as GPCR or not; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it as belonging to one of the following six types: (1) rhodopsin-like (Class A), (2) secretin-like (Class B), (3) metabotropic glutamate/pheromone (Class C), (4) fungal pheromone (Class D), (5) cAMP receptor (Class E), or (6) frizzled/smoothened family (Class F). The overall success rate of GPCR-2L in identifying proteins as GPCRs or non-GPCRs is over 97.2{\%}, while identifying GPCRs among their six types is over 97.8{\%}. Such high success rates were derived by the rigorous jackknife cross-validation on a stringent benchmark dataset, in which none of the included proteins had {\textgreater}/=40{\%} pairwise sequence identity to any other protein in a same subset. As a user-friendly web-server, GPCR-2L is freely accessible to the public at , by which one can obtain the 2-level results in about 20 s for a query protein sequence of 500 amino acids. The longer the sequence is, the more time it may usually need. The high success rates reported here indicate that it is a quite effective approach to identify GPCRs and their types with the functional domain information and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum analysis. It is anticipated that GPCR-2L may become a useful tool for both basic research and drug development in the areas related to GPCRs.},

The subcellular localizations play a key role to elucidate the potential biological functions of these membrane proteins. Although the experimental approaches for determining protein subcellular localizations exist, they are usually costly and time consuming. Thus, computational predictions provided an alternative approach for determining the protein subcellular localizations. However, current subcellular location predictors are generally developed for globular proteins. They did not perform well for membrane proteins. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction algorithm, namely Projected Gene Ontology Score, which introduces the Gene Ontology annotation as a descriptor of the protein. This algorithm could significantly improve the prediction accuracy for the subcellular localizations of membrane proteins. It can designate each protein to one of the eight different locations, while the existing algorithm only covers three locations. Actually, the biological problem considered by our algorithm goes one level deeper than the existing algorithms. In addition, our algorithm can provide more than one location for the testing protein, which could be very useful in practical studies. Our algorithm is expected to be a good complement to the existing algorithms and has the potential to be extended to solve other problems.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multi-label approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions because multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to their non-convexity and discontinuity. These approaches are effective empirically, however, little effort has been devoted to the understanding of their consistency, i.e., the convergence of the risk of learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on this important issue. We first prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Then, we study the consistency of two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss. For ranking loss, our results disclose that, surprisingly, none of convex surrogate loss is consistent; we present the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate losses are proven to be consistent. We also discuss on the consistency of univariate surrogate losses. For hamming loss, we show that two multi-label learning methods, i.e., one-vs-all and pairwise comparison, which can be regarded as direct extensions from multi-class learning, are inconsistent in general cases yet consistent under the dominating setting, and similar results also hold for some recent multi-label approaches that are variations of one-vs-all. In addition, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches that address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although many computational methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization, most of the methods are limited to the prediction of single-location proteins. Multi-location proteins are either not considered or assumed not existing. However, proteins with multiple locations are particularly interesting because they may have special biological functions, which are essential to both basic research and drug discovery. RESULTS: This paper proposes an efficient multi-label predictor, namely mGOASVM, for predicting the subcellular localization of multi-location proteins. Given a protein, the accession numbers of its homologs are obtained via BLAST search. Then, the original accession number and the homologous accession numbers of the protein are used as keys to search against the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation database to obtain a set of GO terms. Given a set of training proteins, a set of T relevant GO terms is obtained by finding all of the GO terms in the GO annotation database that are relevant to the training proteins. These relevant GO terms then form the basis of a T-dimensional Euclidean space on which the GO vectors lie. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a new decision scheme is proposed to classify the multi-label GO vectors. The mGOASVM predictor has the following advantages: (1) it uses the frequency of occurrences of GO terms for feature representation; (2) it selects the relevant GO subspace which can substantially speed up the prediction without compromising performance; and (3) it adopts an efficient multi-label SVM classifier which significantly outperforms other predictors. Briefly, on two recently published virus and plant datasets, mGOASVM achieves an actual accuracy of 88.9{\%} and 87.4{\%}, respectively,which are significantly higher than those achieved by the state-of-the-art predictors such as iLoc-Virus (74.8{\%}) and iLoc-Plant (68.1{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: mGOASVM can efficiently predict the subcellular locations of multi-label proteins. The mGOASVM predictor is available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/mGoaSvmServer/mGOASVM.html.},

abstract = {Protein remote homology detection is one of the central problems in bioinformatics. Although some computational methods have been proposed, the problem is still far from being solved. In this paper, an ensemble classifier for protein remote homology detection, called SVM-Ensemble, was proposed with a weighted voting strategy. SVM-Ensemble combined three basic classifiers based on different feature spaces, including Kmer, ACC, and SC-PseAAC. These features consider the characteristics of proteins from various perspectives, incorporating both the sequence composition and the sequence-order information along the protein sequences. Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that the proposed SVM-Ensemble can obviously improve the predictive performance for the protein remote homology detection. Moreover, it achieved the best performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The life processes of an eukaryotic cell are guided by its nucleus. In addition to the genetic material, the cellular nucleus contains many proteins located at its different compartments, called subnuclear locations. Information of their localization in a nucleus is indispensable for the in-depth study of system biology because, in addition to helping determine their functions, it can provide illuminative insights of how and in what kind of microenvironments these subnuclear proteins are interacting with each other and with other molecules. Facing the deluge of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and effectively annotating the subnuclear locations of numerous newly found nuclear protein sequences. In view of this, a new classifier, called Nuc-PLoc, has been developed that can be used to identify nuclear proteins among the following nine subnuclear locations: (1) chromatin, (2) heterochromatin, (3) nuclear envelope, (4) nuclear matrix, (5) nuclear pore complex, (6) nuclear speckle, (7) nucleolus, (8) nucleoplasm and (9) nuclear promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) body. Nuc-PLoc is featured by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing the evolution information of a protein and its pseudo-amino acid composition. The overall jackknife cross-validation accuracy obtained by Nuc-PLoc is significantly higher than those by the existing methods on the same benchmark data set through the same testing procedure. As a user-friendly web-server, Nuc-PLoc is freely accessible to the public at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Nuc-PLoc.},

abstract = {Apoptotic proteins play key roles in understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death. Knowledge about the subcellular localization of apoptotic protein is constructive in understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death, determining the functional characterization of the protein, screening candidates in drug design, and selecting protein for relevant studies. It is also proclaimed that the information required for determining the subcellular localization of protein resides in their corresponding amino acid sequence. In this work, a new biological feature, class pattern frequency of physiochemical descriptor, was effectively used in accordance with the amino acid composition, protein similarity measure, CTD (composition, translation, and distribution) of physiochemical descriptors, and sequence similarity to predict the subcellular localization of apoptosis protein. AdaBoost with the weak learner as Random-Forest was designed for the five modules and prediction is made based on the weighted voting system. Bench mark dataset of 317 apoptosis proteins were subjected to prediction by our system and the accuracy was found to be 100.0 and 92.4 {\%}, and 90.1 {\%} for self-consistency test, jack-knife test, and tenfold cross validation test respectively, which is 0.9 {\%} higher than that of other existing methods. Beside this, the independent data (N151 and ZW98) set prediction resulted in the accuracy of 90.7 and 87.7 {\%}, respectively. These results show that the protein feature represented by a combined feature vector along with AdaBoost algorithm holds well in effective prediction of subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins. The user friendly web interface "APSLAP" has been constructed, which is freely available at http://apslap.bicpu.edu.in and it is anticipated that this tool will play a significant role in determining the specific role of apoptosis proteins with reliability.},

abstract = {Motivation Determining RNA binding protein(RBP) binding specificity is crucial for understanding many cellular processes and genetic disorders. RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance.

Results We propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input.

The knowledge about inter-residue interactions in protein structures is very helpful to understand the mechanism of protein folding and stability. In this review, we introduce the classification of inter-residue interactions into short, medium and long range based on a simple geometric approach. The features of these interactions in different structural classes of globular and membrane proteins, and in various folds have been delineated. The development of contact potentials and the application of inter-residue contacts for predicting the structural class and secondary structures of globular proteins, solvent accessibility, fold recognition and ab initio tertiary structure prediction have been evaluated. Further, the relationship between inter-residue contacts and protein-folding rates has been highlighted. Moreover, the importance of inter-residue interactions in protein-folding kinetics and for understanding the stability of proteins has been discussed. In essence, the information gained from the studies on inter-residue interactions provides valuable insights for understanding protein folding and de novo protein design.},

Recently, a considerable amount of research has been concerned with the development of "good" multi-label learning methods. Despite the extensive research effort, many scientific challenges posed by e.g. highly imbalanced training sets and correlation among labels remain to be addressed. The aim of this paper is to use a heterogeneous ensemble of multi-label learners to simultaneously tackle both the sample imbalance and label correlation problems. This is different from the existing work in the sense that we are proposing to combine state-of-the-art multi-label methods by ensemble techniques instead of focusing on ensemble techniques within a multi-label learner. The proposed ensemble approach (EML) is applied to six publicly available multi-label data sets from various domains including computer vision, biology and text using several evaluation criteria. We validate the advocated approach experimentally and demonstrate that it yields significant performance gains when compared with state-of-the art multi-label methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sequences do not have explicit features, and the commonly used representations introduce the main drawback of the high dimensionality. For sure, machine learning method devoted to supervised classification tasks are strongly dependent on the feature extraction step, and in order to build a good representation it is necessary to recognize and measure meaningful details of the items to classify. Recently, neural deep learning architectures or deep learning models, were proved to be able to extract automatically useful features from input patterns.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the rapid increase of infection resistance to antibiotics, it is urgent to find novel infection therapeutics. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been utilized as potential alternatives for infection therapeutics. AMPs are key components of the innate immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria. Identifying AMPs and their functional types has led to many studies, and various predictors using machine learning have been developed. However, there is room for improvement; in particular, no predictor takes into account the lack of balance among different functional AMPs. RESULTS: In this paper, a new synthetic minority over-sampling technique on imbalanced and multi-label datasets, referred to as ML-SMOTE, was designed for processing and identifying AMPs' functional families. A novel multi-label classifier, MLAMP, was also developed using ML-SMOTE and grey pseudo amino acid composition. The classifier obtained 0.4846 subset accuracy and 0.16 hamming loss.

abstract = {Background: Protein remote homology detection plays a vital role in studies of protein structures and functions. Almost all of the traditional machine leaning methods require fixed length features to represent the protein sequences. However, it is never an easy task to extract the discriminative features with limited knowledge of proteins. On the other hand, deep learning technique has demonstrated its advantage in automatically learning representations. It is worthwhile to explore the applications of deep learning techniques to the protein remote homology detection. Results: In this study, we employ the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) to learn effective features from pseudo proteins, also propose a predictor called ProDec-BLSTM: it includes input layer, bidirectional LSTM, time distributed dense layer and output layer. This neural network can automatically extract the discriminative features by using bidirectional LSTM and the time distributed dense layer. Conclusion: Experimental results on a widely-used benchmark dataset show that ProDec-BLSTM outperforms other related methods in terms of both the mean ROC and mean ROC50 scores. This promising result shows that ProDec-BLSTM is a useful tool for protein remote homology detection. Furthermore, the hidden patterns learnt by ProDec-BLSTM can be interpreted and visualized, and therefore, additional useful information can be obtained.},

The function of an apoptosis protein is closely related to its subcellular location. It is crucial to develop powerful tools to predict apoptosis protein locations for rapidly increasing gap between the number of known structural proteins and the number of known sequences in protein databank. In this study, amino acids pair compositions with different spaces are used to construct feature sets for representing sample of protein feature selection approach based on binary particle swarm optimization, which is applied to extract effective feature. Ensemble classifier is used as prediction engine, of which the basic classifier is the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor. Each basic classifier is trained with different feature sets. Two datasets often used in prior works are selected to validate the performance of proposed approach. The results obtained by jackknife test are quite encouraging, indicating that the proposed method might become a potentially useful tool for subcellular location of apoptosis protein, or at least can play a complimentary role to the existing methods in the relevant areas.

abstract = {Background: Malaria parasite secretes various proteins in infected RBC for its growth and survival. Thus identification of these secretory proteins is important for developing vaccine/ drug against malaria. The existing motif-based methods have got limited success due to lack of universal motif in all secretory proteins of malaria parasite. Results: In this study a systematic attempt has been made to develop a general method for predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasite. All models were trained and tested on a non-redundant dataset of 252 secretory and 252 non-secretory proteins. We developed SVM models and achieved maximum MCC 0.72 with 85.65{\%} accuracy and MCC 0.74 with 86.45{\%} accuracy using amino acid and dipeptide composition respectively. SVM models were developed using split-amino acid and split-dipeptide composition and achieved maximum MCC 0.74 with 86.40{\%} accuracy and MCC 0.77 with accuracy 88.22{\%} respectively. In this study, for the first time PSSM profiles obtained from PSI-BLAST, have been used for predicting secretory proteins. We achieved maximum MCC 0.86 with 92.66{\%} accuracy using PSSM based SVM model. All models developed in this study were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that secretory proteins have different residue composition than non-secretory proteins. Thus, it is possible to predict secretory proteins from its residue composition-using machine learning technique. The multiple sequence alignment provides more information than sequence itself. Thus performance of method based on PSSM profile is more accurate than method based on sequence composition. A web server PSEApred has been developed for predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasites, the URL can be found in the Availability and requirements section.},

A typical example is the development of prediction algorithms for the subcellular localization sites of input protein sequences. In this review, we mainly focus on the biological grounds of the prediction methods rather than the algorithmic issues because we believe the former will be more fruitful for future development. Recent advances on the study of protein sorting signals will hopefully be incorporated into future prediction methods. Unfortunately, many of the state-of-the-art methods are published without sufficient objective tests. In fact, a simple test employed in this article shows that the performance of specifically developed predictors is not significantly better than that of a homology search. We suspect that this is a general problem associated with the interpretation of genome sequences, which have evolved through gene duplication and speciation.},

abstract = {An intriguing feature of protein folding is that the overall behavior obeys simple physical rules, but the finer details show a great deal of complexity. The scaling of thermodynamic and kinetic properties with protein size is one such rule. However, it is not clear to what extent biologically relevant folding properties (i.e., rates and stabilities) depend on size and/or on other factors such as structure and amino acid sequence. Here we address this question analyzing experimental data on 52 nonmultistate folding proteins with a simple theoretical model. We find that size scaling is the primary factor in determining folding rates, and more surprisingly also protein stability. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the experimental deviations from size predictions are due to minute differences in the fundamental parameters (e.g., less than 2{\%} for the stability). Folding is thus highly sensitive to little changes in protein energetics, but at the same time the folding properties of natural proteins are remarkably homogeneous. These results suggest that evolution has selected a small subset of possibilities from the physically plausible folding catalog and highlight the need for highly accurate protein force fields to predict rates and stabilities beyond general trends.},

The appropriate subcellular localization of proteins is crucial because it provides the physiological context for their function. In this Commentary, we give a brief overview of the different mechanisms that are involved in protein trafficking and describe how aberrant localization of proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Accordingly, modifying the disease-related subcellular mislocalization of proteins might be an attractive means of therapeutic intervention. In particular, cellular processes that link protein folding and cell signaling, as well as nuclear import and export, to the subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed as targets for therapeutic intervention. We discuss the concepts involved in the therapeutic restoration of disrupted physiological protein localization and therapeutic mislocalization as a strategy to inactivate disease-causing proteins.},

abstract = {Proper subcellular localization is critical for proteins to perform their roles in cellular functions. Proteins are transported by different cellular sorting pathways, some of which take a protein through several intermediate locations until reaching its final destination. The pathway a protein is transported through is determined by carrier proteins that bind to specific sequence motifs. In this article, we present a new method that integrates protein interaction and sequence motif data to model how proteins are sorted through these sorting pathways. We use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to represent protein sorting pathways. The model is able to determine intermediate sorting states and to assign carrier proteins and motifs to the sorting pathways. In simulation studies, we show that the method can accurately recover an underlying sorting model. Using data for yeast, we show that our model leads to accurate prediction of subcellular localization. We also show that the pathways learned by our model recover many known sorting pathways and correctly assign proteins to the path they utilize. The learned model identified new pathways and their putative carriers and motifs and these may represent novel protein sorting mechanisms.

Recently, a considerable amount of research has been concerned with the development of "good" multi-label learning methods. Despite the extensive research effort, many scientific challenges posed by e.g. highly Unbalanced training sets and correlation among labels remain to be addressed. The aim of this paper is use heterogeneous ensemble of multi-label learners to simultaneously tackle both imbalance and correlation problems. This is different from the existing work in the sense that the later mainly focuses on ensemble techniques within a multi-label learner while we are proposing in this paper to combine these state-of-the-art multi-label methods by ensemble techniques. The proposed ensemble approach (EML) is applied to three publicly available multi-label data sets using several evaluation criteria. We validate the advocated approach experimentally and demonstrate that it yields significant performance gains when compared with state-of-the art multi-label methods.},

abstract = {For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)(2), a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35{\%}, 85.67{\%}, and 74.58{\%}, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Protein's subcellular location, which indicates where a protein resides in a cell, is an important characteristic of protein. Correctly assigning proteins to their subcellular locations would be of great help to the prediction of proteins' function, genome annotation, and drug design. Yet, in spite of great technical advance in the past decades, it is still time-consuming and laborious to experimentally determine protein subcellular locations on a high throughput scale. Hence, four integrated-algorithm methods were developed to fulfill such high throughput prediction in this article. Two data sets taken from the literature (Chou and Elrod, Protein Eng 12:107-118, 1999) were used as training set and test set, which consisted of 2,391 and 2,598 proteins, respectively. Amino acid composition was applied to represent the protein sequences. The jackknife cross-validation was used to test the training set. The final best integrated-algorithm predictor was constructed by integrating 10 algorithms in Weka (a software tool for tackling data mining tasks, http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) based on an mRMR(Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, http://research.janelia.org/peng/proj/mRMR/) method. It can achieve correct rate of 77.83 and 80.56{\%} for the training set and test set, respectively, which is better than all of the 60 algorithms collected in Weka.

However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases. For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values.},

abstract = {Biological sequences are composed of long strings of alphabetic letters rather than arrays of numerical values. Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.},

abstract = {In addition to the typical random errors that vary between consecutive measurements, the measurements for most all sensors used for target tracking include bias errors that remain relatively fixed during a target tracking episode and are typically characterized by an a priori mean and covariance. Since the bias errors are approximately fixed during a tracking episode, those errors violate the typical assumption of the measurement errors being white noise. Inflating the measurement covariance of the random errors by adding the bias covariance gives track covariances that poorly represent the true errors. The Schmidt-Kalman filter can be used to prevent the track covariances from becoming artificially too small. However, the Schmidt-Kalman filter produces a track covariance that encompasses the random and bias errors. In this paper, the authors formulate the target tracking as a least-square estimation (LSE) problem and show that the track covariance due to the bias errors can be isolated from the track covariance due the random errors. The authors utilize Monte Carlo simulations to verify and illustrate the accuracy of isolation of the bias and random covariances.},

abstract = {Background: The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (telomorph Gibberella zeae) is the causal agent of several destructive crop diseases, where a set of genes usually work in concert to cause diseases to crops. To function appropriately, the F. graminearum proteins inside one cell should be assigned to different compartments, i.e. subcellular localizations. Therefore, the subcellular localizations of F. graminearum proteins can provide insights into protein functions and pathogenic mechanisms of this destructive pathogen fungus. Unfortunately, there are no subcellular localization information for F. graminearum proteins available now. Computational approaches provide an alternative way to predicting F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations due to the expensive and time-consuming biological experiments in lab. Results: In this paper, we developed a novel predictor, namely FGsub, to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations from the primary structures. First, a non-redundant fungi data set with subcellular localization annotation is collected from UniProtKB database and used as training set, where the subcellular locations are classified into 10 groups. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on the training set and used to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations for those proteins that do not have significant sequence similarity to those in training set. The performance of SVMs on training set with 10-fold cross-validation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, for F. graminearum proteins that have significant sequence similarity to those in training set, BLAST is utilized to transfer annotations of homologous proteins to uncharacterized F. graminearum proteins so that the F. graminearum proteins are annotated more comprehensively. Conclusions: In this work, we present FGsub to predict F. graminearum protein subcellular localizations in a comprehensive manner. We make four fold contributions to this filed. First, we present a new algorithm to cope with imbalance problem that arises in protein subcellular localization prediction, which can solve imbalance problem and avoid false positive results. Second, we design an ensemble classifier which employs feature selection to further improve prediction accuracy. Third, we use BLAST to complement machine learning based methods, which enlarges our prediction coverage. Last and most important, we predict the subcellular localizations of 12786 F. graminearum proteins, which provide insights into protein functions and pathogenic mechanisms of this destructive pathogen fungus.},

abstract = {The ability to predict protein folding rates constitutes an important step in understanding the overall folding mechanisms. Although many of the prediction methods are structure based, successful predictions can also be obtained from the sequence. We developed a novel method called prediction of protein folding rates (PPFR), for the prediction of protein folding rates from protein sequences. PPFR implements a linear regression model for each of the mainstream folding dynamics including two-, multi-, and mixed-state proteins. The proposed method provides predictions characterized by strong correlations with the experimental folding rates, which equal 0.87 for the two- and multistate proteins and 0.82 for the mixed-state proteins, when evaluated with out-of-sample jackknife test. Based on in-sample and out-of-sample tests, the PPFR's predictions are shown to be better than most of other sequence only and structure-based predictors and complementary to the predictions of the most recent sequence-based QRSM method. We show that simultaneous incorporation of several characteristics, including the sequence, physiochemical properties of residues, and predicted secondary structure provides improved quality. This hybridized prediction model was analyzed to reveal the complementary factors that can be used in tandem to predict folding rates. We show that bigger proteins require more time for folding, higher helical and coil content and the presence of Phe, Asn, and Gln may accelerate the folding process, the inclusion of Ile, Val, Thr, and Ser may slow down the folding process, and for the two-state proteins increased beta-strand content may decelerate the folding process. Finally, PPFR provides strong correlation when predicting sequences with low similarity.},

abstract = {Although numerous efforts have been made for predicting the subcellular locations of proteins based on their sequence information, it still remains as a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins may have the multiplex character, i.e., they simultaneously exist, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing methods were established on the assumption: a protein has one, and only one, subcellular location. Actually, recent evidence has indicated an increasing number of human proteins having multiple subcellular locations. This kind of multiplex proteins should not be ignored because they may bear some special biological functions worthy of our attention. Based on the accumulation-label scale, a new predictor, called iLoc-Hum, was developed for identifying the subcellular localization of human proteins with both single and multiple location sites. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Hum on a benchmark dataset of human proteins that covers the following 14 location sites: centrosome, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, endosome, extracellular, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, microsome, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, and synapse, where some proteins belong to two, three or four locations but none has 25{\%} or higher pairwise sequence identity to any other in the same subset. For such a complicated and stringent system, the overall success rate achieved by iLoc-Hum was 76{\%}, which is remarkably higher than that by any of the existing predictors that also have the capacity to deal with this kind of system. Further comparisons were also made via two independent datasets; all indicated that the success rates by iLoc-Hum were even more significantly higher than its counterparts. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Hum is freely accessible to the public at or . For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results by choosing either a straightforward submission or a batch submission, without the need to follow the complicated mathematical equations involved.},

abstract = {Tracking historical levels as well as estimating future levels of patent applications is an ongoing activity of considerable significance. The patent applications filings (PAF) are complex to conduct due to its nonlinearity of influenced factors. Support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. Grey theory is a truly multidisciplinary and generic theory that deals with systems that are characterized by poor information and/or for which information is lacking. Grey system theory successfully utilizes accumulated generating data instead of original data to build forecasting model, which makes raw data stochastic weak, or reduces noise influence in a certain extent. However, the application combining grey system theory and SVM for PAF forecasting is rare. In this study, a grey support vector machines with genetic algorithms (GSVMG) is proposed to forecast PAF. In addition, Grey system is used to add a grey layer before neural input layer and white layer after SVM layer. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques. The experiments show that the GSVMG model is outperformed grey model and SVM with genetic algorithms (SVMG) model and PAF forecasting based on GSVMG is of validity and feasibility. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

We select a few most correlated patterns to decide the direction of adjustment. Due to the simplicity of the structure and its fast learning characteristics, this model is good as a real-time controller.

More than 14 500 new experimental locations have been added since its first release in 2007.

SUBA3 also includes detailed localization information for reference organelle datasets and incorporates green fluorescent protein (GFP) images for many proteins. To determine as objectively as possible where a particular protein is located, we have developed SUBAcon, a Bayesian approach that incorporates experimental localization and targeting prediction data to best estimate a protein's location in the cell.

In this work, we showed that Local Ternary Patterns (LTPs) effectively exploit small variations in pixel intensities; present in fluorescence microscopy based protein images of human and hamster cell lines. Further, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is applied to balance the feature space for the classification stage. We observed that LTPs coupled with data balancing technique could enable a classifier, in this case support vector machine, to yield good performance. The proposed ensemble based prediction system, using 10-fold cross-validation, has yielded better performance compared to existing techniques in predicting various subcellular compartments for both 2D HeLa and CHO datasets.

@article{Silva2005,
abstract = {It is an experimental fact that gross topological parameters of the native structure of small proteins presenting two-state kinetics, as relative contact order chi, correlate with the logarithm of their respective folding rate constant kappa(f). However, reported results show specific cases for which the (chi,log kappa(f)) dependence does not follow the overall trend of the entire collection of experimental data. Therefore, an interesting point to be clarified is to what extent the native topology alone can explain these exceptional data. In this work, the structural determinants of the folding kinetics are investigated by means of a 27-mer lattice model, in that each native is represented by a compact self-avoiding (CSA) configuration. The hydrophobic effect and steric constraints are taken as basic ingredients of the folding mechanism, and each CSA configuration is characterized according to its composition of specific patterns (resembling basic structural elements such as loops, sheets, and helices). Our results suggest that (i) folding rate constants are largely influenced by topological details of the native structure, as configurational pattern types and their combinations, and (ii) global parameters, as the relative contact order, may not be effective to detect them. Distinct pattern types and their combinations are determinants of what we call here the "content of secondary-type" structure (sigma) of the native: high sigma implies a large kappa(f). The largest part of all CSA configurations presents a mix of distinct structural patterns, which determine the chixlog kappa(f) linear dependence: Those structures not presenting a proper chi-dependent balance of patterns have their folding kinetics affected with respect to the pretense linear correlation between chi and log kappa(f). The basic physical mechanism relating sigma and kappa(f) involves the concept of cooperativity: If the native is composed of patterns producing a spatial order rich in effective short-range contacts, a properly designed sequence undertakes a fast folding process. On the other hand, the presence of some structural patterns, such as long loops, may reduce substantially the folding performance. This fact is illustrated through natives having a very similar topology but presenting a distinct folding rate kappa(f), and by analyzing structures having the same chi but different sigma.},

As the number of complete genomes rapidly increases, accurate and efficient methods that automatically predict the subcellular localizations become more urgent. In the current paper, we developed a novel method that coupled the discrete wavelet transform with support vector machine based on the amino acid polarity to predict the subcellular localizations of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. The results obtained by the jackknife test were quite promising, and indicated that the proposed method remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of subcellular locations, and could be as an effective and promising high-throughput method in the subcellular localization research.

@article{RamonQuevedo2012,
abstract = {In multilabel classification tasks the aim is to find hypotheses able to predict, for each instance, a set of classes or labels rather than a single one. Some state-of-the-art multilabel learners use a thresholding strategy, which consists in computing a score for each label and then predicting the set of labels whose score is higher than a given threshold. When this score is the estimated posterior probability, the selected threshold is typically 0.5. In this paper we introduce a family of thresholding strategies which take into account the posterior probability of all possible labels to determine a different threshold for each instance. Thus, we exploit some kind of interdependence among labels to compute this threshold, which is optimal regarding a given expected loss function. We found experimentally that these strategies outperform other thresholding options for multilabel classification. They provide an efficient method to implement a learner which considers the interdependence among labels in the sense that the overall performance of the prediction of a set of labels prevails over that of each single label.},

In this study, we propose newDNA-Prot, a DNA-binding protein predictor that employs support vector machine classifier and a comprehensive feature representation. The sequence representation are categorized into 6 groups: primary sequence based, evolutionary profile based, predicted secondary structure based, predicted relative solvent accessibility based, physicochemical property based and biological function based features. The mRMR, wrapper and two-stage feature selection methods are employed for removing irrelevant features and reducing redundant features. Experiments demonstrate that the two-stage method performs better than the mRMR and wrapper methods. We also perform a statistical analysis on the selected features and results show that more than 95{\%} of the selected features are statistically significant and they cover all 6 feature groups. The newDNA-Prot method is compared with several state of the art algorithms, including iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot. The results demonstrate that newDNA-Prot method outperforms the iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot methods. More specific, newDNA-Prot improves the runner-up method, DNA-Prot for around 10{\%} on several evaluation measures.

With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identifying the sigma(54) promoters. Here, a predictor called 'iPro54-PseKNC' was developed. In the predictor, the samples of DNA sequences were formulated by a novel feature vector called 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', which was further optimized by the incremental feature selection procedure. The performance of iPro54-PseKNC was examined by the rigorous jackknife cross-validation tests on a stringent benchmark data set. As a user-friendly web-server, iPro54-PseKNC is freely accessible at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iPro54-PseKNC. For the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step protocol guide was provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematics that were presented in this paper just for its integrity. Meanwhile, we also discovered through an in-depth statistical analysis that the distribution of distances between the transcription start sites and the translation initiation sites were governed by the gamma distribution, which may provide a fundamental physical principle for studying the sigma(54) promoters.},

The availability of greater computational resources, more data, new algorithms for training deep models and easy to use libraries for implementation and training of neural networks are the drivers of this development. The use of deep learning has been especially successful in image recognition; and the development of tools, applications and code examples are in most cases centered within this field rather than within biology. Results Here, we aim to further the development of deep learning methods within biology by providing application examples and ready to apply and adapt code templates. Given such examples, we illustrate how architectures consisting of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks can relatively easily be designed and trained to state-of-the-art performance on three biological sequence problems: prediction of subcellular localization, protein secondary structure and the binding of peptides to MHC Class II molecules.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Eusocial insects are particularly useful for investigating the evolutionary link between protein sequence and condition-dependent patterns of gene expression because gene expression plays a central role in determining differences between eusocial insect sexes and castes. We investigated the relationship between protein coding sequence evolution and gene expression patterns in the fire ants Solenopsis invicta, S. richteri, and their hybrids to gain greater insight into how selection jointly operates on gene expression and coding sequence. We found that genes with high expression variability within castes and sexes were frequently differentially expressed between castes and sexes, as well as between species and hybrids. These results indicate that genes showing high variation in expression in one context also tend to show high variation in expression in other contexts. Our analyses further revealed that variation in both intra- and interspecific gene expression was positively associated with rate of protein sequence evolution in Solenopsis. This suggests that selective constraints on a gene operate both at the level of protein sequence and at the level of gene expression regulation. Overall, our study provides one of the strongest demonstrations that selective constraints mediate both protein sequence evolution and gene expression variability across different biological contexts and timescales.},

abstract = {DNA-binding proteins are crucial for various cellular processes, such as recognition of specific nucleotide, regulation of transcription, and regulation of gene expression. Developing an effective model for identifying DNA-binding proteins is an urgent research problem. Up to now, many methods have been proposed, but most of them focus on only one classifier and cannot make full use of the large number of negative samples to improve predicting performance. This study proposed a predictor called enDNA-Prot for DNA-binding protein identification by employing the ensemble learning technique. Experiential results showed that enDNA-Prot was comparable with DNA-Prot and outperformed DNAbinder and iDNA-Prot with performance improvement in the range of 3.97-9.52{\%} in ACC and 0.08-0.19 in MCC. Furthermore, when the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the performance of enDNA-Prot outperformed the three existing methods by 2.83-16.63{\%} in terms of ACC and 0.02-0.16 in terms of MCC. It indicated that enDNA-Prot is an effective method for DNA-binding protein identification and expanding training dataset with negative samples can improve its performance. For the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, we developed a user-friendly web-server for enDNA-Prot which is freely accessible to the public.},

abstract = {Predicting protein subcellular localization is a challenging problem, particularly when query proteins have multi-label features meaning that they may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular location sites. Most of the existing methods can only be used to deal with the single-label proteins. Actually, multi-label proteins should not be ignored because they usually bear some special function worthy of in-depth studies. By introducing the "multi-label learning" approach, a new predictor, called iLoc-Animal, has been developed that can be used to deal with the systems containing both single- and multi-label animal (metazoan except human) proteins. Meanwhile, to measure the prediction quality of a multi-label system in a rigorous way, five indices were introduced; they are "Absolute-True", "Absolute-False" (or Hamming-Loss"), "Accuracy", "Precision", and "Recall". As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation was performed with iLoc-Animal on a benchmark dataset of animal proteins classified into the following 20 location sites: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) centriole, (4) centrosome, (5) cell cortex, (6) cytoplasm, (7) cytoskeleton, (8) endoplasmic reticulum, (9) endosome, (10) extracellular, (11) Golgi apparatus, (12) lysosome, (13) mitochondrion, (14) melanosome, (15) microsome, (16) nucleus, (17) peroxisome, (18) plasma membrane, (19) spindle, and (20) synapse, where many proteins belong to two or more locations. For such a complicated system, the outcomes achieved by iLoc-Animal for all the aforementioned five indices were quite encouraging, indicating that the predictor may become a useful tool in this area. It has not escaped our notice that the multi-label approach and the rigorous measurement metrics can also be used to investigate many other multi-label problems in molecular biology. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Animal is freely accessible to the public at the web-site .},

abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multi-label approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions because multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to their non-convexity and discontinuity. These approaches are effective empirically, however, little effort has been devoted to the understanding of their consistency, i.e., the convergence of the risk of learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on this important issue. We first prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Then, we study the consistency of two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss. For ranking loss, our results disclose that, surprisingly, none of convex surrogate loss is consistent; we present the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate losses are proven to be consistent. We also discuss on the consistency of univariate surrogate losses. For hamming loss, we show that two multi-label learning methods, i.e., one-vs-all and pairwise comparison, which can be regarded as direct extensions from multi-class learning, are inconsistent in general cases yet consistent under the dominating setting, and similar results also hold for some recent multi-label approaches that are variations of one-vs-all. In addition, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches that address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.},

abstract = {We consider the regression problem for financial time series. Typically, financial time series are non-stationary and volatile in nature. Because of its good generalization power and the tractability of the problem, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been extensively applied in financial time series prediction. The standard SVR adopts the l(p)-norm (p = 1 or 2) to model the functional complexity of the whole data set and employs a fixed c-tube to tolerate noise. Although this approach has proved successful both theoretically and empirically, it considers data in a global fashion only. Therefore it may lack the flexibility to capture the local trend of data; this is a critical aspect of volatile data, especially financial time series data. Aiming to address this issue, we propose the Local Support Vector Regression (LSVR) model. This novel model is demonstrated to provide a systematic and automatic scheme to adapt the margin locally and flexibly; the margin is fixed globally in the standard SVR. Therefore, the LSVR can tolerate noise adaptively. We provide both theoretical justifications and empirical evaluations for this novel model. The experimental results on synthetic data and real financial data demonstrate its advantages over the standard SVR.},

Several machine learning methods have been developed for computational prediction of primary protein sequences because wet experiments are costly and time consuming. However, two problems still exist in state-of-the-art methods. First, several proteins appear in different subcellular structures simultaneously, whereas current methods only predict one protein sequence in one subcellular structure. Second, most software tools are trained with obsolete data and the latest new databases are missed. We proposed a novel multi-label classification algorithm to solve the first problem and integrated several latest databases to improve prediction performance. Experiments proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. The present study would facilitate research on cellular proteomics.},

abstract = {Protein secretion is an important biological process for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Several sequence-based methods mainly rely on utilizing various types of complementary features to design accurate classifiers for predicting non-classical secretory proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) terms are increasing informative in predicting protein functions. However, the number of used GO terms is often very large. For example, there are 60,020 GO terms used in the prediction method Euk-mPLoc 2.0 for subcellular localization. This study proposes a novel approach to identify a small set of m top-ranked GO terms served as the only type of input features to design a support vector machine (SVM) based method Sec-GO to predict non-classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. To evaluate the Sec-GO method, two existing methods and their used datasets are adopted for performance comparisons. The Sec-GO method using m=436 GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of 96.7{\%} on mammalian proteins, much better than the existing method SPRED (82.2{\%}) which uses frequencies of tri-peptides and short peptides, secondary structure, and physicochemical properties as input features of a random forest classifier. Furthermore, when applying to Gram-positive bacterial proteins, the Sec-GO with m=158 GO terms has a test accuracy of 94.5{\%}, superior to NClassG+ (90.0{\%}) which uses SVM with several feature types, comprising amino acid composition, di-peptides, physicochemical properties and the position specific weighting matrix. Analysis of the distribution of secretory proteins in a GO database indicates the percentage of the non-classical secretory proteins annotated by GO is larger than that of classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Of the m top-ranked GO features, the top-four GO terms are all annotated by such subcellular locations as GO:0005576 (Extracellular region). Additionally, the method Sec-GO is easily implemented and its web tool of prediction is available at iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/secgo.},

abstract = {Malaria is one of the world's most common and serious diseases causing death of about 3 million people each year. Its most severe occurrence is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum. Reports have shown that the resistance of the parasite to existing drugs is increasing. Therefore, there is a huge and urgent need to discover and validate new drug or vaccine targets to enable the development of new treatments for malaria. The ability to discover these drug or vaccine targets can only be enhanced from our deep understanding of the detailed biology of the parasite, for example how cells function and how proteins organize into modules such as metabolic, regulatory and signal transduction pathways. It has been noted that the knowledge of signalling transduction pathways in Plasmodium is fundamental to aid the design of new strategies against malaria. This work uses a linear-time algorithm for finding paths in a network under modified biologically motivated constraints. We predicted several important signalling transduction pathways in Plasmodium falciparum. We have predicted a viable signalling pathway characterized in terms of the genes responsible that may be the PfPKB pathway recently elucidated in Plasmodium falciparum. We obtained from the FIKK family, a signal transduction pathway that ends up on a chloroquine resistance marker protein, which indicates that interference with FIKK proteins might reverse Plasmodium falciparum from resistant to sensitive phenotype. We also proposed a hypothesis that showed the FIKK proteins in this pathway as enabling the resistance parasite to have a mechanism for releasing chloroquine (via an efflux process). Furthermore, we also predicted a signalling pathway that may have been responsible for signalling the start of the invasion process of Red Blood Cell (RBC) by the merozoites. It has been noted that the understanding of this pathway will give insight into the parasite virulence and will facilitate rational vaccine design against merozoites invasion. And we have a host of other predicted pathways, some of which have been used in this work to predict the functionality of some proteins.},

abstract = {Proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Proteins with multiple locations or dynamic feature of this kind are particularly interesting because they may have some very special biological functions intriguing to investigators in both basic research and drug discovery. For instance, among the 6408 human protein entries that have experimentally observed subcellular location annotations in the Swiss-Prot database (version 50.7, released 19-Sept-2006), 973 ( approximately 15{\%}) have multiple location sites. The number of total human protein entries (except those annotated with "fragment" or those with less than 50 amino acids) in the same database is 14,370, meaning a gap of (14,370-6408)=7962 entries for which no knowledge is available about their subcellular locations. Although one can use the computational approach to predict the desired information for the gap, so far all the existing methods for predicting human protein subcellular localization are limited in the case of single location site only. To overcome such a barrier, a new ensemble classifier, named Hum-mPLoc, was developed that can be used to deal with the case of multiple location sites as well. Hum-mPLoc is freely accessible to the public as a web server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/hum-multi. Meanwhile, for the convenience of people working in the relevant areas, Hum-mPLoc has been used to identify all human protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results thus obtained have been deposited in a downloadable file prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab{\_}Hum-mPLoc.xls". This file is available at the same website and will be updated twice a year to include new entries of human proteins and reflect the continuous development of Hum-mPLoc.},

abstract = {Here we assessed the use of domain families for predicting the functions of whole proteins. These 'functional families' (FunFams) were derived using a protocol that combines sequence clustering with supervised cluster evaluation, relying on available high-quality Gene Ontology (GO) annotation data in the latter step. In essence, the protocol groups domain sequences belonging to the same superfamily into families based on the GO annotations of their parent proteins. An initial test based on enzyme sequences confirmed that the FunFams resemble enzyme (domain) families much better than do families produced by sequence clustering alone. For the CAFA 2011 experiment, we further associated the FunFams with GO terms probabilistically. All target proteins were first submitted to domain superfamily assignment, followed by FunFam assignment and, eventually, function assignment. The latter included an integration step for multi-domain target proteins. The CAFA results put our domain-based approach among the top ten of 31 competing groups and 56 prediction methods, confirming that it outperforms simple pairwise whole-protein sequence comparisons.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to predict the stock price instantly at any given time. One problem with predicting stock prices is that there may be a large or small difference in two continuous sets of data. The other problem is that the volume of stock data is so large that it affects our ability to use it. To solve these problems, we constructed a data mart to reduce the size of stock data and combined fuzzification techniques with the grey theory to develop a fuzzy grey prediction as One of predicting functions in our system to predict the possible answer immediately. To demonstrate that our system is working correctly, we used our prediction system to analyse stock data and to predict the stock price promptly at a specific time. The system can effectively help stock dealers deal with day trading. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidencetheoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab-Signal-3L.xls", and will be updated once a year to include new protein entries and reflect the continuous development of Signal-3L.

abstract = {Malaria is one of the world's most common and serious diseases causing death of about 3 million people each year. Its most severe occurrence is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum. Reports have shown that the resistance of the parasite to existing drugs is increasing. Therefore, there is a huge and urgent need to discover and validate new drug or vaccine targets to enable the development of new treatments for malaria. The ability to discover these drug or vaccine targets can only be enhanced from our deep understanding of the detailed biology of the parasite, for example how cells function and how proteins organize into modules such as metabolic, regulatory and signal transduction pathways. It has been noted that the knowledge of signalling transduction pathways in Plasmodium is fundamental to aid the design of new strategies against malaria. This work uses a linear-time algorithm for finding paths in a network under modified biologically motivated constraints. We predicted several important signalling transduction pathways in Plasmodium falciparum. We have predicted a viable signalling pathway characterized in terms of the genes responsible that may be the PfPKB pathway recently elucidated in Plasmodium falciparum. We obtained from the FIKK family, a signal transduction pathway that ends up on a chloroquine resistance marker protein, which indicates that interference with FIKK proteins might reverse Plasmodium falciparum from resistant to sensitive phenotype. We also proposed a hypothesis that showed the FIKK proteins in this pathway as enabling the resistance parasite to have a mechanism for releasing chloroquine (via an efflux process). Furthermore, we also predicted a signalling pathway that may have been responsible for signalling the start of the invasion process of Red Blood Cell (RBC) by the merozoites. It has been noted that the understanding of this pathway will give insight into the parasite virulence and will facilitate rational vaccine design against merozoites invasion. And we have a host of other predicted pathways, some of which have been used in this work to predict the functionality of some proteins.},

abstract = {Determining the catalytic residues in an enzyme is critical to our understanding the relationship between protein sequence, structure, function, and enhancing our ability to design novel enzymes and their inhibitors. Although many enzymes have been sequenced, and their primary and tertiary structures determined, experimental methods for enzyme functional characterization lag behind. Because experimental methods used for identifying catalytic residues are resource- and labor-intensive, computational approaches have considerable value and are highly desirable for their ability to complement experimental studies in identifying catalytic residues and helping to bridge the sequence–structure–function gap. In this study, we describe a new computational method called PREvaIL for predicting enzyme catalytic residues. This method was developed by leveraging a comprehensive set of informative features extracted from multiple levels, including sequence, structure, and residue-contact network, in a random forest machine-learning framework. Extensive benchmarking experiments on eight different datasets based on 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests, as well as side-by-side performance comparisons with seven modern sequence- and structure-based methods, showed that PREvaIL achieved competitive predictive performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve ranging from 0.896 to 0.973 and from 0.294 to 0.523, respectively. We demonstrated that this method was able to capture useful signals arising from different levels, leveraging such differential but useful types of features and allowing us to significantly improve the performance of catalytic residue prediction. We believe that this new method can be utilized as a valuable tool for both understanding the complex sequence–structure–function relationships of proteins and facilitating the characterization of novel enzymes lacking functional annotations.},

Till now, many efforts have been tried, but most of which used only a single algorithm. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble classifier of KNN (k-nearest neighbor) and SVM (support vector machine) algorithms to predict the subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins based on a voting system. The overall prediction accuracies by the one-versus-one strategy are 78.17{\%}, 89.94{\%} and 75.55{\%} for three benchmark datasets of eukaryotic proteins. The improved prediction accuracies reveal that GO annotations and hydrophobicity of amino acids help to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins.},

abstract = {Nearest-neighbor (NN) rules provide a simple and powerful quantitative framework for RNA structure prediction that is strongly supported for canonical Watson-Crick duplexes from a plethora of thermodynamic measurements. Predictions of RNA secondary structure based on nearest-neighbor (NN) rules are routinely used to understand biological function and to engineer and control new functions in biotechnology. However, NN applications to RNA structural features such as internal and terminal loops rely on approximations and assumptions, with sparse experimental coverage of the vast number of possible sequence and structural features. To test to what extent NN rules accurately predict thermodynamic stabilities across RNAs with non-WC features, we tested their predictions using a quantitative high-throughput assay platform, RNA-MaP. Using a thermodynamic assay with coupled protein binding, we carried out equilibrium measurements for over 1000 RNAs with a range of predicted secondary structure stabilities. Our results revealed substantial scatter and systematic deviations between NN predictions and observed stabilities. Solution salt effects and incorrect or omitted loop parameters contribute to these observed deviations. Our results demonstrate the need to independently and quantitatively test NN computational algorithms to identify their capabilities and limitations. RNA-MaP and related approaches can be used to test computational predictions and can be adapted to obtain experimental data to improve RNA secondary structure and other prediction algorithms.

Significance statement RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are routinely used to understand, predict and design functional RNA structures in biology and biotechnology. Given the vast number of RNA sequence and structural features, these predictions rely on a series of approximations, and independent tests are needed to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of predicted RNA structural stabilities. Here we measure the stabilities of over 1000 RNA constructs by using a coupled protein binding assay. Our results reveal substantial deviations from the RNA stabilities predicted by popular algorithms, and identify factors contributing to the observed deviations. We demonstrate the importance of quantitative, experimental tests of computational RNA structure predictions and present an approach that can be used to routinely test and improve the prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Computational methods for predicting protein subcellular localization have used various types of features, including N-terminal sorting signals, amino acid compositions, and text annotations from protein databases. Our approach does not use biological knowledge such as the sorting signals or homologues, but use just protein sequence information. The method divides a protein sequence into short k-mer sequence fragments which can be mapped to word features in document classification. A large number of class association rules are mined from the protein sequence examples that range from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. Then, a boosting algorithm is applied to those rules to build up a final classifier. Experimental results using benchmark data sets show that our method is excellent in terms of both the classification performance and the test coverage. The result also implies that the k-mer sequence features which determine subcellular locations do not necessarily exist in specific positions of a protein sequence.

abstract = {As the key components of innate immunity, human host defense antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) play a critical role in warding off invading microbial pathogens. In addition, AMPs can possess other biological functions such as apoptosis, wound healing, and immune modulation. This article provides an overview on the identification, activity, 3D structure, and mechanism of action of human AMPs selected from the antimicrobial peptide database. Over 100 such peptides have been identified from a variety of tissues and epithelial surfaces, including skin, eyes, ears, mouths, gut, immune, nervous and urinary systems. These peptides vary from 10 to 150 amino acids with a net charge between -3 and +20 and a hydrophobic content below 60{\%}. The sequence diversity enables human AMPs to adopt various 3D structures and to attack pathogens by different mechanisms. While alpha-defensin HD-6 can self-assemble on the bacterial surface into nanonets to entangle bacteria, both HNP-1 and beta-defensin hBD-3 are able to block cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II. Lysozyme is well-characterized to cleave bacterial cell wall polysaccharides but can also kill bacteria by a non-catalytic mechanism. The two hydrophobic domains in the long amphipathic alpha-helix of human cathelicidin LL-37 lays the basis for binding and disrupting the curved anionic bacterial membrane surfaces by forming pores or via the carpet model. Furthermore, dermcidin may serve as ion channel by forming a long helix-bundle structure. In addition, the C-type lectin RegIIIalpha can initially recognize bacterial peptidoglycans followed by pore formation in the membrane. Finally, histatin 5 and GAPDH(2-32) can enter microbial cells to exert their effects. It appears that granulysin enters cells and kills intracellular pathogens with the aid of pore-forming perforin. This arsenal of human defense proteins not only keeps us healthy but also inspires the development of a new generation of personalized medicine to combat drug-resistant superbugs, fungi, viruses, parasites, or cancer. Alternatively, multiple factors (e.g., albumin, arginine, butyrate, calcium, cyclic AMP, isoleucine, short-chain fatty acids, UV B light, vitamin D, and zinc) are able to induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides, opening new avenues to the development of anti-infectious drugs.},

abstract = {Various approaches to partitioning of high-dimensional input space have been studied with the intent of developing homogeneous clusters formed over input and output spaces of variables encountered in system modeling. In this study, we propose a new design methodology of a fuzzy model where the input space is partitioned by making use of sonic classification algorithm, especially, fuzzy K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier being guided by some auxiliary information granules formed in the output space. This classifier being regarded in the context of this design as a supervision mechanism is used to capture the distribution of data over the output space. This type of supervision is beneficial when developing the structure in the input space. It is demonstrated that data involved in a partition constructed by the fuzzy K-NN method realized in the input space show a high level of homogeneity with regard to the data present in the output space. This enhances the performance of the fuzzy rule-based model whose premises in the rules involve partitions formed by the fuzzy K-NN. The design is illustrated with the aid of numeric examples that also provide a detailed insight into the performance of the fuzzy models and quantify several crucial design issues.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accomplishment of the various genome sequencing projects resulted in accumulation of massive amount of gene sequence information. This calls for a large-scale computational method for predicting protein localization from sequence. The protein localization can provide valuable information about its molecular function, as well as the biological pathway in which it participates. The prediction of localization of a protein at subnuclear level is a challenging task. In our previous work we proposed an SVM-based system using protein sequence information for this prediction task. In this work, we assess protein similarity with Gene Ontology (GO) and then improve the performance of the system by adding a module of nearest neighbor classifier using a similarity measure derived from the GO annotation terms for protein sequences. RESULTS: The performance of the new system proposed here was compared with our previous system using a set of proteins resided within 6 localizations collected from the Nuclear Protein Database (NPD). The overall MCC (accuracy) is elevated from 0.284 (50.0{\%}) to 0.519 (66.5{\%}) for single-localization proteins in leave-one-out cross-validation; and from 0.420 (65.2{\%}) to 0.541 (65.2{\%}) for an independent set of multi-localization proteins. The new system is available at http://array.bioengr.uic.edu/subnuclear.htm. CONCLUSION: The prediction of protein subnuclear localizations can be largely influenced by various definitions of similarity for a pair of proteins based on different similarity measures of GO terms. Using the sum of similarity scores over the matched GO term pairs for two proteins as the similarity definition produced the best predictive outcome. Substantial improvement in predicting protein subnuclear localizations has been achieved by combining Gene Ontology with sequence information.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of genomic and molecular information is the basis for understanding higher-order biological systems, such as the cell and the organism, and their interactions with the environment, as well as for medical, industrial and other practical applications. The KEGG resource (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to biological systems, categorized as building blocks in the genomic space (KEGG GENES) and the chemical space (KEGG LIGAND), and wiring diagrams of interaction networks and reaction networks (KEGG PATHWAY). A fourth component, KEGG BRITE, has been formally added to the KEGG suite of databases. This reflects our attempt to computerize functional interpretations as part of the pathway reconstruction process based on the hierarchically structured knowledge about the genomic, chemical and network spaces. In accordance with the new chemical genomics initiatives, the scope of KEGG LIGAND has been significantly expanded to cover both endogenous and exogenous molecules. Specifically, RPAIR contains curated chemical structure transformation patterns extracted from known enzymatic reactions, which would enable analysis of genome-environment interactions, such as the prediction of new reactions and new enzyme genes that would degrade new environmental compounds. Additionally, drug information is now stored separately and linked to new KEGG DRUG structure maps.},

It is therefore important to develop accurate high-throughput methods for identifying PPI to better understand protein function, disease occurrence, and therapy design. Though various computational methods for predicting PPI have been developed, their robustness for prediction with external datasets is unknown. Deep-learning algorithms have achieved successful results in diverse areas, but their effectiveness for PPI prediction has not been tested. We used a stacked autoencoder, a type of deep-learning algorithm, to study the sequence-based PPI prediction. The best model achieved an average accuracy of 97.19{\%} with 10-fold cross-validation. The prediction accuracies for various external datasets ranged from 87.99{\%} to 99.21{\%}, which are superior to those achieved with previous methods. To our knowledge, this research is the first to apply a deep-learning algorithm to sequence-based PPI prediction, and the results demonstrate its potential in this field.},

abstract = {Motivation: Subcellular localization of proteins is one of the most significant characteristics of living cells. Prediction of protein subcellular locations is crucial to the understanding of various protein functions. Therefore, an accurate, computationally efficient and reliable prediction system is required. Results: In this article, the predictions of various Support Vector Machine (SVM) models have been combined through majority voting. The proposed ensemble SVM-SubLoc has achieved the highest success rates of 99.7{\%} using hybrid features of Haralick textures and local binary patterns (HarLBP), 99.4{\%} using hybrid features of Haralick textures and Local Ternary Patterns (HarLTP). In addition, SVM-SubLoc has yielded 99.0{\%} accuracy using only local ternary patterns (LTPs) based features. The dimensionality of HarLBP feature vector is 581 compared with 78 and 52 for HarLTP and LTPs, respectively. Hence, SVM-SubLoc in conjunction with LTPs is fast, sufficiently accurate and simple predictive system. The proposed SVM-SubLoc approach thus provides superior prediction performance using the reduced feature space compared with existing approaches.},

Sequence similarity and domain architecture searches are combined with protein-protein interaction network data to derive consensus predictions for GO terms using functional enrichment.

The latter provides output supporting the GO term predictions with the annotating sequences.

abstract = {The information of the Gene Ontology annotation is helpful in the explanation of life science phenomena, and can provide great support for the research of the biomedical field. The use of the Gene Ontology is gradually affecting the way people store and understand bioinformatic data. To facilitate the prediction of gene functions with the aid of text mining methods and existing resources, we transform it into a multi-label top-down classification problem and develop a method that uses the hierarchical relationships in the Gene Ontology structure to relieve the quantitative imbalance of positive and negative training samples. Meanwhile the method enhances the discriminating ability of classifiers by retaining and highlighting the key training samples. Additionally, the top-down classifier based on a tree structure takes the relationship of target classes into consideration and thus solves the incompatibility between the classification results and the Gene Ontology structure. Our experiment on the Gene Ontology annotation corpus achieves an F-value performance of 50.7{\%} (precision: 52.7{\%} recall: 48.9{\%}). The experimental results demonstrate that when the size of training set is small, it can be expanded via topological propagation of associated documents between the parent and child nodes in the tree structure. The top-down classification model applies to the set of texts in an ontology structure or with a hierarchical relationship.},

abstract = {Protein remote homology detection is an important task in computational proteomics. Some computational methods have been proposed, which detect remote homology proteins based on different features and algorithms. As noted in previous studies, their predictive results are complementary to each other. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore whether these methods can be combined into one package so as to further enhance the performance power and application convenience. In view of this, we introduced a protein representation called profile-based pseudo protein sequence to extract the evolutionary information from the relevant profiles. Based on the concept of pseudo proteins, a new predictor, called “dRHP-PseRA”, was developed by combining four state-of-the-art predictors (PSI-BLAST, HHblits, Hmmer, and Coma) via the rank aggregation approach. Cross-validation tests on a SCOP benchmark dataset have demonstrated that the new predictor has remarkably outperformed any of the existing methods for the same purpose on ROC50 scores. Accordingly, it is anticipated that dRHP-PseRA holds very high potential to become a useful high throughput tool for detecting remote homology proteins. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web-server for dRHP-PseRA has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/dRHP-PseRA/.},

abstract = {Background: Many biological processes are mediated by dynamic interactions between and among proteins. In order to interact, two proteins must co-occur spatially and temporally. As protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and subcellular location (SCL) are discovered via separate empirical approaches, PPI and SCL annotations are independent and might complement each other in helping us to understand the role of individual proteins in cellular networks. We expect reliable PPI annotations to show that proteins interacting in vivo are co-located in the same cellular compartment. Our goal here is to evaluate the potential of using PPI annotation in determining SCL of proteins in human, mouse, fly and yeast, and to identify and quantify the factors that contribute to this complementarity. Results: Using publicly available data, we evaluate the hypothesis that interacting proteins must be co-located within the same subcellular compartment. Based on a large, manually curated PPI dataset, we demonstrate that a substantial proportion of interacting proteins are in fact co-located. We develop an approach to predict the SCL of a protein based on the SCL of its interaction partners, given sufficient confidence in the interaction itself. The frequency of false positive PPIs can be reduced by use of six lines of supporting evidence, three based on type of recorded evidence (empirical approach, multiplicity of databases, and multiplicity of literature citations) and three based on type of biological evidence (inferred biological process, domain-domain interactions, and orthology relationships), with biological evidence more-effective than recorded evidence. Our approach performs better than four existing prediction methods in identifying the SCL of membrane proteins, and as well as or better for soluble proteins. Conclusion: Understanding cellular systems requires knowledge of the SCL of interacting proteins. We show how PPI data can be used more effectively to yield reliable SCL predictions for both soluble and membrane proteins. Scope exists for further improvement in our understanding of cellular function through consideration of the biological context of molecular interactions.},

abstract = {Background: RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and secondary structure specificities is challenging for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs detection. Results: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. Conclusion: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: How long does it take to be proficient in diagnosing pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) of the rectum with transvaginal sonography (TVS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Sonographers familiar with the general use of TVS are expected to be proficient in the diagnosis of endometriosis nodules of the rectum and the detection of POD obliteration using the 'sliding sign' after approximately 40 examinations, performed in a referral clinic for pelvic pain. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: With rectal DIE, the reasons for the obvious diagnostic problems are complex. Menstrual pain or cramps are still considered to be 'normal' and do not provide a reason for patients and even health-care providers to seek expert help. Furthermore, the performance of TVS for diagnosing pelvic endometriosis has been shown to be accurate only in experienced hands. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: This prospective study included 121 selected patients with suspected endometriosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Symptomatic patients, referred to a pelvic pain clinic, were examined by an expert sonographer (E.S.) and consecutively by two trainees (T1/2). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The learning curve using the cumulative sum shows that the trainees, listed as T1/T2, reached the predefined level of proficiency in detecting bowel nodules after examining 42 and 37 patients, for T1 and T2, respectively. The prevalence rate of bowel nodules demonstrated by the ES was 21{\%}. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) as well as the accuracy for TVS of T1 and T2 in comparison with the results of ES were 72 and 89, 96 and 95, 87 and 80, 90 and 98, and 89 and 94{\%}, respectively. The prevalence rate of POD obliteration, as demonstrated by a negative sliding sign, was 27{\%}. The trainees reached the predefined level of proficiency after examining 42 and 33 patients, for T1 and T2, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV as well as the accuracy of TVS for T1 and T2 in comparison with the results of the ES were 83 and 89, 95 and 95, 91 and 80, 90 and 98, and 91 and 94{\%}, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We performed this analysis in a tertiary referral centre with a high number of advanced cases of DIE, not reflecting a standard population. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Integrated in TVS training courses, typical sonographic video clips for DIE of the rectum, including the use of disease-specific signs, could help to improve diagnostic accuracy in DIE and shorten diagnostic delays. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: No funding was received for this study. None of the authors has any competing interests.},

abstract = {Recently, pedestrian attributes like gender, age, clothing etc., have been used as soft biometric traits for recognizing people. Unlike existing methods that assume the independence of attributes during their prediction, we propose a multi-label convolutional neural network (MLCNN) to predict multiple attributes together in a unified framework. Firstly, a pedestrian image is roughly divided into multiple overlapping body parts, which are simultaneously integrated in the multi-label convolutional neural network. Secondly, these parts are filtered independently and aggregated in the cost layer. The cost function is a combination of multiple binary attribute classification cost functions. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the SVM based method on the PETA database.},

abstract = {The integral membrane protein M2 of influenza virus forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope(1). The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins - a required process for unpacking of the viral genome(2). In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans- Golgi network ( TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm(3). Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti- viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication(4-7). Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy- terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward- facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C- terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid- facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix - helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening.},

abstract = {The analysis and identification of wear particles for machine condition monitoring is usually conducted by experienced inspectors, and, thus, the process is usually very time-consuming. To overcome this obstacle, grey system theory has been applied in this study. The theory of grey systems is a new technique to perform prediction, relational analysis and decision making in many areas. In this paper, the theory of grey relational grades has been used to classify six types of metallic wear debris whose three-dimensional images are acquired from laser scanning confocal microscopy. Their boundary morphology and surface topology are then described by certain numerical parameters. Since the parameters have different levels of significance for different types of wear debris for particle identification, weighting factors of the parameters have been taken into consideration. To determine the weighting factors for the study, fuzzy logic has been applied. This study has demonstrated that a grey system combined with fuzzy logic can be used to classify wear particles satisfactorily. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using the pseudo amino acid (PseAA) composition to represent the sample of a protein can incorporate a considerable amount of sequence pattern information so as to improve the prediction quality for its structural or functional classification. However, how to optimally formulate the PseAA composition is an important problem yet to be solved. In this article the grey modeling approach is introduced that is particularly efficient in coping with complicated systems such as the one consisting of many proteins with different sequence orders and lengths. On the basis of the grey model, four coefficients derived from each of the protein sequences concerned are adopted for its PseAA components. The PseAA composition thus formulated is called the "grey-PseAA" composition that can catch the essence of a protein sequence and better reflect its overall pattern. In our study we have demonstrated that introduction of the grey-PseAA composition can remarkably enhance the success rates in predicting the protein structural class. It is anticipated that the concept of grey-PseAA composition can be also used to predict many other protein attributes, such as subcellular localization, membrane protein type, enzyme functional class, GPCR type, protease type, among many others.},

abstract = {Subcellular locations of proteins are important functional attributes. An effective and efficient subcellular localization predictor is necessary for rapidly and reliably annotating subcellular locations of proteins. Most of existing subcellular localization methods are only used to deal with single-location proteins. Actually, proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. To better reflect characteristics of multiplex proteins, it is highly desired to develop new methods for dealing with them. In this paper, a new predictor, called Euk-ECC-mPLoc, by introducing a powerful multi-label learning approach which exploits correlations between subcellular locations and hybridizing gene ontology with dipeptide composition information, has been developed that can be used to deal with systems containing both singleplex and multiplex eukaryotic proteins. It can be utilized to identify eukaryotic proteins among the following 22 locations: (1) acrosome, (2) cell membrane, (3) cell wall, (4) centrosome, (5) chloroplast, (6) cyanelle, (7) cytoplasm, (8) cytoskeleton, (9) endoplasmic reticulum, (10) endosome, (11) extracellular, (12) Golgi apparatus, (13) hydrogenosome, (14) lysosome, (15) melanosome, (16) microsome, (17) mitochondrion, (18) nucleus, (19) peroxisome, (20) spindle pole body, (21) synapse, and (22) vacuole. Experimental results on a stringent benchmark dataset of eukaryotic proteins by jackknife cross validation test show that the average success rate and overall success rate obtained by Euk-ECC-mPLoc were 69.70{\%} and 81.54{\%}, respectively, indicating that our approach is quite promising. Particularly, the success rates achieved by Euk-ECC-mPLoc for small subsets were remarkably improved, indicating that it holds a high potential for simulating the development of the area. As a user-friendly web-server, Euk-ECC-mPLoc is freely accessible to the public at the website http://levis.tongji.edu.cn:8080/bioinfo/Euk-ECC-mPLoc/. We believe that Euk-ECC-mPLoc may become a useful high-throughput tool, or at least play a complementary role to the existing predictors in identifying subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins.},

The correct recognition rate of ensembled DN-Fold for Top 1 predictions is 84.5{\%}, 61.5{\%}, and 33.6{\%} and for Top 5 is 91.2{\%}, 76.5{\%}, and 60.7{\%} at family, superfamily, and fold levels, respectively. We also evaluated the performance of single DN-Fold (DN-FoldS), which showed the comparable results at the level of family and superfamily, compared to ensemble DN-Fold.

abstract = {Motivation: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) take over 5-10{\%} of the eukaryotic proteome and play key roles in many biological processes, e.g. gene regulation. Experimental detection of RBP binding sites is still time-intensive and high-costly. Instead, computational prediction of the RBP binding sites using patterns learned from existing annotation knowledge is a fast approach. From the biological point of view, the local structure context derived from local sequences will be recognized by specific RBPs. However, in computational modeling using deep learning, to our best knowledge, only global representations of entire RNA sequences are employed. So far, the local sequence information is ignored in the deep model construction process. Results: In this study, we present a computational method iDeepE to predict RNA-protein binding sites from RNA sequences by combining global and local convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For the global CNN, we pad the RNA sequences into the same length. For the local CNN, we split a RNA sequence into multiple overlapping fixed-length subsequences, where each subsequence is a signal channel of the whole sequence. Next, we train deep CNNs for multiple subsequences and the padded sequences to learn high-level features, respectively. Finally, the outputs from local and global CNNs are combined to improve the prediction. iDeepE demonstrates a better performance over state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets derived from CLIP-seq. We also find that the local CNN runs 1.8 times faster than the global CNN with comparable performance when using GPUs. Our results show that iDeepE has captured experimentally verified binding motifs. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepE.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most proteins have evolved in specific cellular compartments that limit their functions and potential interactions. On the other hand, motifs define amino acid arrangements conserved between protein family members and represent powerful tools for assigning function to protein sequences. The ideal motif would identify all members of a protein family but in practice many motifs identify both family members and unrelated proteins, referred to as True Positive (TP) and False Positive (FP) sequences, respectively. RESULTS: To address the relationship between protein motifs, protein function and cellular localization, we systematically assigned subcellular localization data to motif sequences from the comprehensive PROSITE sequence motif database. Using this data we analyzed relationships between localization and function. We find that TPs and FPs have a strong tendency to localize in different compartments. When multiple localizations are considered, TPs are usually distributed between related cellular compartments. We also identified cases where FPs are concentrated in particular subcellular regions, indicating possible functional or evolutionary relationships with TP sequences of the same motif. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the systematic examination of subcellular localization has the potential to uncover evolutionary and functional relationships between motif-containing sequences. We believe that this type of analysis complements existing motif annotations and could aid in their interpretation. Our results shed light on the evolution of cellular organelles and potentially establish the basis for new subcellular localization and function prediction algorithms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Study of drug-target interaction networks is an important topic for drug development. It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48{\%}, 80.78{\%}, 78.49{\%}, and 85.66{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the network prediction system thus established is quite promising and encouraging.},

@article{Zhou2012,
abstract = {Directly applying single-label classification methods to the multi-label learning problems substantially limits both the performance and speed due to the imbalance, dependence and high dimensionality of the given label matrix. Existing methods either ignore these three problems or reduce one with the price of aggravating another. In this paper, we propose a {\{}0,1{\}} label matrix compression and recovery method termed "compressed labeling (CL)" to simultaneously solve or at least reduce these three problems. CL first compresses the original label matrix to improve balance and independence by preserving the signs of its Gaussian random projections. Afterward, we directly utilize popular binary classification methods (e.g., support vector machines) for each new label. A fast recovery algorithm is developed to recover the original labels from the predicted new labels. In the recovery algorithm, a "labelset distilling method" is designed to extract distilled labelsets (DLs), i.e., the frequently appeared label subsets from the original labels via recursive clustering and subtraction. Given a distilled and an original label vector, we discover that the signs of their random projections have an explicit joint distribution that can be quickly computed from a geometric inference. Based on this observation, the original label vector is exactly determined after performing a series of Kullback-Leibler divergence based hypothesis tests on the distribution about the new labels. CL significantly improves the balance of the training samples and reduces the dependence between different labels. Moreover, it accelerates the learning process by training fewer binary classifiers for compressed labels, and makes use of label dependence via DLs based tests. Theoretically, we prove the recovery bounds of CL which verifies the effectiveness of CL for label compression and multi-label classification performance improvement brought by label correlations preserved in DLs. We show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of CL via 5 groups of experiments on 21 datasets from text classification, image annotation, scene classification, music categorization, genomics and web page classification.},

abstract = {Motivation: The computational identification of non-coding RNA regions on the genome is currently receiving much attention. However, it is essentially harder than gene-finding problems for protein-coding regions because non-coding RNA sequences do not have strong statistical signals. Since comparative sequence analysis is effective for non-coding RNA detection, efficient computational methods are expected for structural alignment of RNA sequences. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish the structural alignment tasks for RNA sequences, and we found that one of the most important points is to estimate an accurate score matrix for calculating structural alignments. Results: We propose a novel approach for RNA structural alignment based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach has some specific features compared with previous methods in the sense that the parameters for structural alignment are estimated such that the model can most probably discriminate between correct alignments and incorrect alignments, and has the generalization ability so that a satisfiable score matrix can be obtained even with a small number of sample data without overfitting. Experimental results clearly show that the parameter estimation with CRFs can outperform all the other existing methods for structural alignments of RNA sequences. Furthermore, structural alignment search based on CRFs is more accurate for predicting non-coding RNA regions than the other scoring methods. These experimental results strongly support our discriminative method employing CRFs to estimate the score matrix parameters. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

@article{Grahnen2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein sequence evolution is constrained by the biophysics of folding and function, causing interdependence between interacting sites in the sequence. However, current site-independent models of sequence evolutions do not take this into account. Recent attempts to integrate the influence of structure and biophysics into phylogenetic models via statistical/informational approaches have not resulted in expected improvements in model performance. This suggests that further innovations are needed for progress in this field. RESULTS: Here we develop a coarse-grained physics-based model of protein folding and binding function, and compare it to a popular informational model. We find that both models violate the assumption of the native sequence being close to a thermodynamic optimum, causing directional selection away from the native state. Sampling and simulation show that the physics-based model is more specific for fold-defining interactions that vary less among residue type. The informational model diffuses further in sequence space with fewer barriers and tends to provide less support for an invariant sites model, although amino acid substitutions are generally conservative. Both approaches produce sequences with natural features like dN/dS {\textless} 1 and gamma-distributed rates across sites. CONCLUSIONS: Simple coarse-grained models of protein folding can describe some natural features of evolving proteins but are currently not accurate enough to use in evolutionary inference. This is partly due to improper packing of the hydrophobic core. We suggest possible improvements on the representation of structure, folding energy, and binding function, as regards both native and non-native conformations, and describe a large number of possible applications for such a model.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure determination has primarily been performed using X-ray crystallography. To overcome the expensive cost, high attrition rate and series of trial-and-error settings, many in-silico methods have been developed to predict crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. However, the majority of these methods build their predictors by extracting features from protein sequences, which is computationally expensive and can explode the feature space. We propose DeepCrystal, a deep learning framework for sequence-based protein crystallization prediction. It uses deep learning to identify proteins which can produce diffraction quality crystals without the need to manually engineer additional biochemical and structural features from sequence. Our model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can exploit frequently occurring k-mers and sets of k-mers from the protein sequences to distinguish proteins that will result in diffraction quality crystals from those that will not. Results: Our model surpasses previous sequence-based protein crystallization predictors in terms of recall, F-score, accuracy and MCC on three independent test sets. DeepCrystal achieves an average improvement of 1.4{\%}, 12.1{\%} in recall, when compared to its closest competitors, Crysalis II and Crysf respectively. In addition, DeepCrystal attains an average improvement of 2.1{\%}, 6.0{\%} for F-score, 1.9{\%}, 3.9{\%} for accuracy and 3.8{\%}, 7.0{\%} for MCC w.r.t.

The comparison between the prediction results and the measured data demonstrates that,the prediction is an extent of variable force rather than a certain point for the given turning conditions, and that the measured force drops into the extent with a smaller relative error.

abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

In this work, we study how deep convolutional neural network methods (ConvNets) may be best designed and developed to solve this long-standing problem. With publicly available datasets, we designed and trained various ConvNet architectures. We tested several recent deep learning techniques including wide residual networks, dropouts, and dilated convolutions. We studied the improvements in the precision of medium-range and long-range contacts, and compared the performance of our best architectures with the ones used in existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed ConvNet architectures predict contacts with significantly more precision than the architectures used in several state-of-the-art methods. When trained using the DeepCov dataset consisting of 3,456 proteins and tested on PSICOV dataset of 150 proteins, our architectures achieve up to 15{\%} higher precision when L/2 long-range contacts are evaluated.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled through molecular logic circuits that combine regulatory signals of many different factors. In particular, complexation of transcription factors (TFs) and other regulatory proteins is a prevailing and highly conserved mechanism of signal integration within critical regulatory pathways and enables us to infer controlled genes as well as the exerted regulatory mechanism. Common approaches for protein complex prediction that only use protein interaction networks, however, are designed to detect self-contained functional complexes and have difficulties to reveal dynamic combinatorial assemblies of physically interacting proteins. RESULTS: We developed the novel algorithm DACO that combines protein-protein interaction networks and domain-domain interaction networks with the cluster-quality metric cohesiveness. The metric is locally maximized on the holistic level of protein interactions, and connectivity constraints on the domain level are used to account for the exclusive and thus inherently combinatorial nature of the interactions within such assemblies. When applied to predicting TF complexes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed approach outperformed popular complex prediction methods by far. Furthermore, we were able to assign many of the predictions to target genes, as well as to a potential regulatory effect in agreement with literature evidence.

abstract = {Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability.},

We understand as global methods the ones concerned with the aim of constructing a model for the whole problem space using the totality of the available observations. Local methods focus into sub regions of the space, possibly using an appropriately selected subset of the sample. In the proposed method, the sample is first divided in local cells by using a Vector Quantization unsupervised algorithm, the LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray). In a second stage, the generated assemblage of much easier problems is locally solved with a scheme inspired by Bayes' rule. Four classification methods were implemented for comparison purposes with the proposed scheme: Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ); Feedforward Neural Networks: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors. These four methods and the proposed scheme were implemented in eleven datasets, two controlled experiments, plus nine public available datasets from the UCI repository. The proposed method has shown a quite competitive performance when compared to these classical and largely used classifiers. Our method is simple concerning understanding and implementation and is based on very intuitive concepts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One relation is based on the content of secondary structure elements, and the other uses the number of residues of each of the following types: hydrophobic, positively charged, and negatively charged. Both relations incorporate the chain length as an indirect descriptor. The correlation between experimental values for folding rates and free energy is poor, providing little support to the "stability gap" hypothesis based on the folding of simple lattice and off-lattice polymers. The average rate-determining barrier height for these two-state proteins is much larger than the small barriers for the transition-state ensemble envisaged by theoretical models.},

abstract = {A multi-label classification based approach for sentiment analysis is proposed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose to use multi-label classification for sentiment classification of microblogs. The proposed prototype has three main components, text segmentation, feature extraction, and multi-label classification. Raw segmented words and sentiment features based on the three different sentiment dictionaries, Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary, National Taiwan University Sentiment Dictionary and HowNet Dictionary, are the features and the bag of words is the feature representation. A detailed empirical study of different multi-label classification methods on sentiment classification is conducted to compare their classification performances. Specifically, total 11 state of the art multi-label classification methods are compared on two microblog datasets and 8 evaluation metrics are used. The effects of the three sentiment dictionaries for multi-label classification are empirically studied and compared, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been performed. The performed empirical comparisons show that Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary has the best performance among the three different sentiment dictionaries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With the explosion of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic era, it is highly desirable to develop high-throughput tools for rapidly and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. The knowledge thus obtained can help us timely utilize these newly found protein sequences for both basic research and drug discovery. Many bioinformatics tools have been developed by means of machine learning methods. This review is focused on the applications of a new kind of science (cellular automata) in protein bioinformatics. A cellular automaton (CA) is an open, flexible and discrete dynamic model that holds enormous potentials in modeling complex systems, in spite of the simplicity of the model itself. Researchers, scientists and practitioners from different fields have utilized cellular automata for visualizing protein sequences, investigating their evolution processes, and predicting their various attributes. Owing to its impressive power, intuitiveness and relative simplicity, the CA approach has great potential for use as a tool for bioinformatics.},

abstract = {The integration of high-throughput genomic data represents an opportunity for deciphering the interplay between structural and functional organization of genomes and for discovering novel biomarkers. However, the development of integrative approaches to complement gene expression (GE) data with other types of gene information, such as copy number (CN) and chromosomal localization, still represents a computational challenge in the genomic arena. This work presents a computational procedure that directly integrates CN and GE profiles at genome-wide level. When applied to DNA/RNA paired data, this approach leads to the identification of Significant Overlaps of Differentially Expressed and Genomic Imbalanced Regions (SODEGIR). This goal is accomplished in three steps. The first step extends to CN a method for detecting regional imbalances in GE. The second part provides the integration of CN and GE data and identifies chromosomal regions with concordantly altered genomic and transcriptional status in a tumor sample. The last step elevates the single-sample analysis to an entire dataset of tumor specimens. When applied to study chromosomal aberrations in a collection of astrocytoma and renal carcinoma samples, the procedure proved to be effective in identifying discrete chromosomal regions of coordinated CN alterations and changes in transcriptional levels.},

abstract = {Background: Many biological processes are mediated by dynamic interactions between and among proteins. In order to interact, two proteins must co-occur spatially and temporally. As protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and subcellular location (SCL) are discovered via separate empirical approaches, PPI and SCL annotations are independent and might complement each other in helping us to understand the role of individual proteins in cellular networks. We expect reliable PPI annotations to show that proteins interacting in vivo are co-located in the same cellular compartment. Our goal here is to evaluate the potential of using PPI annotation in determining SCL of proteins in human, mouse, fly and yeast, and to identify and quantify the factors that contribute to this complementarity. Results: Using publicly available data, we evaluate the hypothesis that interacting proteins must be co-located within the same subcellular compartment. Based on a large, manually curated PPI dataset, we demonstrate that a substantial proportion of interacting proteins are in fact co-located. We develop an approach to predict the SCL of a protein based on the SCL of its interaction partners, given sufficient confidence in the interaction itself. The frequency of false positive PPIs can be reduced by use of six lines of supporting evidence, three based on type of recorded evidence (empirical approach, multiplicity of databases, and multiplicity of literature citations) and three based on type of biological evidence (inferred biological process, domain-domain interactions, and orthology relationships), with biological evidence more-effective than recorded evidence. Our approach performs better than four existing prediction methods in identifying the SCL of membrane proteins, and as well as or better for soluble proteins. Conclusion: Understanding cellular systems requires knowledge of the SCL of interacting proteins. We show how PPI data can be used more effectively to yield reliable SCL predictions for both soluble and membrane proteins. Scope exists for further improvement in our understanding of cellular function through consideration of the biological context of molecular interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA repair is the general term for the collection of critical mechanisms which repair many forms of DNA damage such as methylation or ionizing radiation. DNA repair has mainly been studied in experimental and clinical situations, and relatively few information-based approaches to new extracting DNA repair knowledge exist. As a first step, automatic detection of DNA repair proteins in genomes via informatics techniques is desirable; however, there are many forms of DNA repair and it is not a straightforward process to identify and classify repair proteins with a single optimal method. We perform a study of the ability of homology and machine learning-based methods to identify and classify DNA repair proteins, as well as scan vertebrate genomes for the presence of novel repair proteins. Combinations of primary sequence polypeptide frequency, secondary structure, and homology information are used as feature information for input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM). RESULTS: We identify that SVM techniques are capable of identifying portions of DNA repair protein datasets without admitting false positives; at low levels of false positive tolerance, homology can also identify and classify proteins with good performance. Secondary structure information provides improved performance compared to using primary structure alone. Furthermore, we observe that machine learning methods incorporating homology information perform best when data is filtered by some clustering technique. Analysis by applying these methodologies to the scanning of multiple vertebrate genomes confirms a positive correlation between the size of a genome and the number of DNA repair protein transcripts it is likely to contain, and simultaneously suggests that all organisms have a non-zero minimum number of repair genes. In addition, the scan result clusters several organisms' repair abilities in an evolutionarily consistent fashion. Analysis also identifies several functionally unconfirmed proteins that are highly likely to be involved in the repair process. A new web service, INTREPED, has been made available for the immediate search and annotation of DNA repair proteins in newly sequenced genomes. CONCLUSION: Despite complexity due to a multitude of repair pathways, combinations of sequence, structure, and homology with Support Vector Machines offer good methods in addition to existing homology searches for DNA repair protein identification and functional annotation. Most importantly, this study has uncovered relationships between the size of a genome and a genome's available repair repertoire, and offers a number of new predictions as well as a prediction service, both which reduce the search time and cost for novel repair genes and proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a key role in diverse physiological processes and are the targets of almost two-thirds of the marketed drugs. The 3 D structures of GPCRs are largely unavailable; however, a large number of GPCR primary sequences are known. To facilitate the identification and characterization of novel receptors, it is therefore very valuable to develop a computational method to accurately predict GPCRs from the protein primary sequences. RESULTS: We propose a new method called PCA-GPCR, to predict GPCRs using a comprehensive set of 1497 sequence-derived features. The principal component analysis is first employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space to 32. Then, the resulting 32-dimensional feature vectors are fed into a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, called intimate sorting, to predict GPCRs at five levels. The prediction at the first level determines whether a protein is a GPCR or a non-GPCR. If it is predicted to be a GPCR, then it will be further predicted into certain family, subfamily, sub-subfamily and subtype by the classifiers at the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels, respectively. To train the classifiers applied at five levels, a non-redundant dataset is carefully constructed, which contains 3178, 1589, 4772, 4924, and 2741 protein sequences at the respective levels. Jackknife tests on this training dataset show that the overall accuracies of PCA-GPCR at five levels (from the first to the fifth) can achieve up to 99.5{\%}, 88.8{\%}, 80.47{\%}, 80.3{\%}, and 92.34{\%}, respectively. We further perform predictions on a dataset of 1238 GPCRs at the second level, and on another two datasets of 167 and 566 GPCRs respectively at the fourth level. The overall prediction accuracies of our method are consistently higher than those of the existing methods to be compared. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive set of 1497 features is believed to be capable of capturing information about amino acid composition, sequence order as well as various physicochemical properties of proteins. Therefore, high accuracies are achieved when predicting GPCRs at all the five levels with our proposed method.},

abstract = {Protein sequence evolution has resulted in a vast repertoire of molecular functionality crucial to life. Despite the central importance of sequence evolution to biology, our fundamental understanding of how sequence composition affects evolution is incomplete. This report describes the utilization of lattice model simulations of directed evolution, which indicate that, on average, peptide and protein evolvability is strongly dependent on initial sequence composition. The report also discusses two distinct regimes of sequence evolution by point mutation: (a) the "classical" mode where sequences "crawl" over free energy barriers towards acquiring a target fold, and (b) the "quantum" mode where sequences appear to "tunnel" through large energy barriers generally insurmountable by means of a crawl. Finally, the simulations indicate that oily and charged peptides are the most efficient substrates for evolution at the "classical" and "quantum" regimes, respectively, and that their respective response to temperature is commensurate with analogies made to barrier crossing in classical and quantum systems. On the whole, these results show that sequence composition can tune both the evolvability and the optimal mode of evolution of peptides and proteins.},

abstract = {Precise information about protein locations in a cell facilitates in the understanding of the function of a protein and its interaction in the cellular environment. This information further helps in the study of the specific metabolic pathways and other biological processes. We propose an ensemble approach called "CE-PLoc" for predicting subcellular locations based on fusion of individual classifiers. The proposed approach utilizes features obtained from both dipeptide composition (DC) and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) based feature extraction strategies. Different feature spaces are obtained by varying the dimensionality using PseAAC for a selected base learner. The performance of the individual learning mechanisms such as support vector machine, nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, covariant discriminant, which are trained using PseAAC based features is first analyzed. Classifiers are developed using same learning mechanism but trained on PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. These classifiers are combined through voting strategy and an improvement in prediction performance is achieved. Prediction performance is further enhanced by developing CE-PLoc through the combination of different learning mechanisms trained on both DC based feature space and PseAAC based feature spaces of varying dimensions. The predictive performance of proposed CE-PLoc is evaluated for two benchmark datasets of protein subcellular locations using accuracy. MCC, and Q-statistics. Using the jackknife test, prediction accuracies of 81.47 and 83.99{\%} are obtained for 12 and 14 subcellular locations datasets, respectively. In case of independent dataset test, prediction accuracies are 87.04 and 87.33{\%} for 12 and 14 class datasets, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An intriguing feature of protein folding is that the overall behavior obeys simple physical rules, but the finer details show a great deal of complexity. The scaling of thermodynamic and kinetic properties with protein size is one such rule. However, it is not clear to what extent biologically relevant folding properties (i.e., rates and stabilities) depend on size and/or on other factors such as structure and amino acid sequence. Here we address this question analyzing experimental data on 52 nonmultistate folding proteins with a simple theoretical model. We find that size scaling is the primary factor in determining folding rates, and more surprisingly also protein stability. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the experimental deviations from size predictions are due to minute differences in the fundamental parameters (e.g., less than 2{\%} for the stability). Folding is thus highly sensitive to little changes in protein energetics, but at the same time the folding properties of natural proteins are remarkably homogeneous. These results suggest that evolution has selected a small subset of possibilities from the physically plausible folding catalog and highlight the need for highly accurate protein force fields to predict rates and stabilities beyond general trends.},

abstract = {DNA-binding proteins are crucial for various cellular processes, such as recognition of specific nucleotide, regulation of transcription, and regulation of gene expression. Developing an effective model for identifying DNA-binding proteins is an urgent research problem. Up to now, many methods have been proposed, but most of them focus on only one classifier and cannot make full use of the large number of negative samples to improve predicting performance. This study proposed a predictor called enDNA-Prot for DNA-binding protein identification by employing the ensemble learning technique. Experiential results showed that enDNA-Prot was comparable with DNA-Prot and outperformed DNAbinder and iDNA-Prot with performance improvement in the range of 3.97-9.52{\%} in ACC and 0.08-0.19 in MCC. Furthermore, when the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the performance of enDNA-Prot outperformed the three existing methods by 2.83-16.63{\%} in terms of ACC and 0.02-0.16 in terms of MCC. It indicated that enDNA-Prot is an effective method for DNA-binding protein identification and expanding training dataset with negative samples can improve its performance. For the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, we developed a user-friendly web-server for enDNA-Prot which is freely accessible to the public.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding cellular systems requires the knowledge of a protein's subcellular localization (SCL). Although experimental and predicted data for protein SCL are archived in various databases, SCL prediction remains a non-trivial problem in genome annotation. Current SCL prediction tools use amino-acid sequence features and text mining approaches. A comprehensive analysis of protein SCL in human PPI and metabolic networks for various subcellular compartments is necessary for developing a robust SCL prediction methodology. Results: Based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) and metabolite-linked protein interaction (MLPI) networks of proteins, we have compared, contrasted and analysed the statistical properties across different subcellular compartments. We integrated PPI and metabolic datasets with SCL information of human proteins from LOCATE and GOA (Gene Ontology Annotation) and estimated three statistical properties: Chi-square (chi(2)) test, Paired Localisation Correlation Profile (PLCP) and network topological measures. For the PPI network, Pearson's chi-square test shows that for the same SCL category, twice as many interacting protein pairs are observed than estimated when compared to non-interacting protein pairs (chi(2) = 1270.19, P-value {\textless}2.2 x 10(-16)), whereas for MLPI, metabolite-linked protein pairs having the same SCL are observed 20{\%} more than expected, compared to non-metabolite linked proteins (chi(2) = 110.02, P-value {\textless}2.2 x 10(-16)). To address the issue of proteins with multiple SCLs, we have specifically used the PLCP (Pair Localization Correlation Profile) measure. PLCP analysis revealed that protein interactions are majorly restricted to the same SCL, though significant cross-compartment interactions are seen for nuclear proteins. Metabolite-linked protein pairs are restricted to specific compartments such as the mitochondrion (P-value {\textless}6.0e-07), the lysosome (P-value {\textless}4.7e-05) and the Golgi apparatus (P-value {\textless}1.0e-15). These findings indicate that the metabolic network adds value to the information in the PPI network for the localisation process of proteins in human subcellular compartments. Conclusions: The MLPI network differs significantly from the PPI network in its SCL distribution. The PPI network shows passive protein interaction, possibly due to its high false positive rate, across different subcellular compartments, which seem to be absent in the MLPI network, as the MLPI network has evolved to maintain high substrate specificity for proteins.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Targeted kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment, but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict. Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene expression and mutation status. High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools for determining kinase dependency, but drug polypharmacology can make results difficult to interpret. RESULTS: We developed Kinase Addiction Ranker (KAR), an algorithm that integrates high-throughput drug screening data, comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene expression profiles to identify kinase dependency in cancer cells. We applied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 151 leukemia patient samples using published datasets. We experimentally validated KAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung cancer cell line H1581, showing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and AZD8055.

The ability to learn powerful features automatically is increasingly important as the volume of data and range of applications of machine learning methods continues to grow. This paper proposes a new deep architecture that uses support vector machines (SVMs) with class probability output networks (CPONs) to provide better generalization power for pattern classification problems. As a result, deep features are extracted without additional feature engineering steps, using multiple layers of the SVM classifiers with CPONs. The proposed structure closely approaches the ideal Bayes classifier as the number of layers increases.

abstract = {The information of the Gene Ontology annotation is helpful in the explanation of life science phenomena, and can provide great support for the research of the biomedical field. The use of the Gene Ontology is gradually affecting the way people store and understand bioinformatic data. To facilitate the prediction of gene functions with the aid of text mining methods and existing resources, we transform it into a multi-label top-down classification problem and develop a method that uses the hierarchical relationships in the Gene Ontology structure to relieve the quantitative imbalance of positive and negative training samples. Meanwhile the method enhances the discriminating ability of classifiers by retaining and highlighting the key training samples. Additionally, the top-down classifier based on a tree structure takes the relationship of target classes into consideration and thus solves the incompatibility between the classification results and the Gene Ontology structure. Our experiment on the Gene Ontology annotation corpus achieves an F-value performance of 50.7{\%} (precision: 52.7{\%} recall: 48.9{\%}). The experimental results demonstrate that when the size of training set is small, it can be expanded via topological propagation of associated documents between the parent and child nodes in the tree structure. The top-down classification model applies to the set of texts in an ontology structure or with a hierarchical relationship.},

abstract = {Motivation: The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only.
Results: Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78{\%} for 10 categories; 92{\%} for membrane-bound or soluble), outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms, including those relying on homology information.

abstract = {Motivation: Various bacterial pathogens can deliver their secreted substrates also called effectors through Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) into host cells and cause diseases. Since T3SS secreted effectors (T3SEs) play important roles in pathogen'host interactions, identifying them is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of T3SSs. However, the effectors display high level of sequence diversity, therefore making the identification a difficult process. There is a need to develop a novel and effective method to screen and select putative novel effectors from bacterial genomes that can be validated by a smaller number of key experiments. Results: We develop a deep convolution neural network to directly classify any protein sequence into T3SEs or non-T3SEs, which is useful for both effector prediction and the study of sequence-function relationship. Different from traditional machine learning-based methods, our method automatically extracts T3SE-related features from a protein N-Terminal sequence of 100 residues and maps it to the T3SEs space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from 16 species, yielding an average classification accuracy of 83.7{\%} in the 5-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 92.6{\%} for the test set. Moreover, when comparing with known state-of-The-Art prediction methods, the accuracy of our method is 6.31-20.73{\%} higher than previous methods on a common independent dataset. Besides, we visualize the convolutional kernels and successfully identify the key features of T3SEs, which contain important signal information for secretion. Finally, some effectors reported in the literature are used to further demonstrate the application of DeepT3.},

abstract = {Over the years, there have been claims that evolution proceeds according to systematically different processes over different timescales and that protein evolution behaves in a non-Markovian manner. On the other hand, Markov models are fundamental to many applications in evolutionary studies. Apparent non-Markovian or time-dependent behavior has been attributed to influence of the genetic code at short timescales and dominance of physicochemical properties of the amino acids at long timescales. However, any long time period is simply the accumulation of many short time periods, and it remains unclear why evolution should appear to act systematically differently across the range of timescales studied. We show that the observed time-dependent behavior can be explained qualitatively by modeling protein sequence evolution as an aggregated Markov process (AMP): a time-homogeneous Markovian substitution model observed only at the level of the amino acids encoded by the protein-coding DNA sequence. The study of AMPs sheds new light on the relationship between amino acid-level and codon-level models of sequence evolution, and our results suggest that protein evolution should be modeled at the codon level rather than using amino acid substitution models.},

abstract = {In most fields of scientific endeavor, the outcomes of important experiments are not always known before the experiments are performed. But in protein structure prediction, algorithms are usually developed and tested in situations where the answers are known. In December 1996, the Second Meeting on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP2) was held in Asilomar, California to rectify this situation: protein sequences were provided in advance for which the experimental structure had not yet been published. Over 70 research groups provided bona fide predictions on 42 targets in four categories: comparative or 'homology' modeling, fold recognition or 'threading', ab initio structure predictions, and docking predictions. Since the previous CASP meeting in 1994, the role of fold recognition in structure prediction has increased enormously with the largest number of groups participating in this category. In this review, we highlight some of the important developments and give at least a qualitative sense of what kind of methods produced some of the better predictions.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its great power in image classification. In real world, there are many images contain abundant contents so that they have multiple labels. Moreover, there are correlations between labels. Traditional deep methods for such data rarely take into account such correlations. In this paper, we propose a dual-CNN model, i.e., Dual-CNN model for Multi-Label classification (Dual-CNN-ML), which can make full use of the dependencies of labels to enhance classification performance. Specifically, we first obtain co-occurrence dependency matrix from training datasets; then, we merge the co-occurrence dependency matrix and image representation together; finally, we use the new representation to predict labels of samples. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains satisfying results and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In multilabel classification tasks the aim is to find hypotheses able to predict, for each instance, a set of classes or labels rather than a single one. Some state-of-the-art multilabel learners use a thresholding strategy, which consists in computing a score for each label and then predicting the set of labels whose score is higher than a given threshold. When this score is the estimated posterior probability, the selected threshold is typically 0.5. In this paper we introduce a family of thresholding strategies which take into account the posterior probability of all possible labels to determine a different threshold for each instance. Thus, we exploit some kind of interdependence among labels to compute this threshold, which is optimal regarding a given expected loss function. We found experimentally that these strategies outperform other thresholding options for multilabel classification. They provide an efficient method to implement a learner which considers the interdependence among labels in the sense that the overall performance of the prediction of a set of labels prevails over that of each single label.},

abstract = {Protein folding speeds are known to vary over more than eight orders of magnitude. Plaxco, Simons, and Baker (see References) first showed a correlation of folding speed with the topology of the native protein. That and subsequent studies showed, if the native structure of a protein is known, its folding speed can be predicted reasonably well through a correlation with the "localness" of the contacts in the protein. In the present work, we develop a related measure, the geometric contact number, N (alpha), which is the number of nonlocal contacts that are well-packed, by a Voronoi criterion. We find, first, that in 80 proteins, the largest such database of proteins yet studied, N (alpha) is a consistently excellent predictor of folding speeds of both two-state fast folders and more complex multistate folders. Second, we show that folding rates can also be predicted from amino acid sequences directly, without the need to know the native topology or other structural properties.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel inverse random under sampling (IRUS) method is proposed for the class imbalance problem. The main idea is to severely under sample the majority class thus creating a large number of distinct training sets. For each training set we then find a decision boundary which separates the minority class from the majority class. By combining the multiple designs through fusion, we construct a composite boundary between the majority class and the minority class. The proposed methodology is applied on 22 UCI data sets and experimental results indicate a significant increase in performance when compared with many existing class-imbalance learning methods. We also present promising results for multi-label classification, a challenging research problem in many modern applications such as music, text and image categorization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By choosing the 1-peptide compositions on the N-terminal regions with 20 residues as the only input vector, the prediction performance achieves 86.86{\%} accuracy with 0.69 Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) by the jackknife test. Moreover, by combining with the hydropathy distribution along protein sequence and several reduced amino acid alphabets, we achieved maximum MCC 0.82 with accuracy 92{\%} in the jackknife test by using the developed ID model. When evaluating on an independent dataset our method performs better than existing methods. The results indicate that the ID is a simple and efficient prediction method for mitochondrial proteins of malaria parasite.},

abstract = {Model learning from class imbalanced training data is a long-standing and significant challenge for machine learning. In particular, existing deep learning methods consider mostly either class balanced data or moderately imbalanced data in model training, and ignore the challenge of learning from significantly imbalanced training data. To address this problem, we formulate a class imbalanced deep learning model based on batch-wise incremental minority (sparsely sampled) class rectification by hard sample mining in majority (frequently sampled) classes during model training. This model is designed to minimise the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely sampled boundaries of minority classes in an iterative batch-wise learning process. To that end, we introduce a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) function that can be deployed readily in deep network architectures. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on three imbalanced person attribute benchmark datasets (CelebA, X-Domain, DeepFashion) and one balanced object category benchmark dataset (CIFAR-100). These experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages and model scalability of the proposed batch-wise incremental minority class rectification model over the existing state-of-the-art models for addressing the problem of imbalanced data learning.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of normal examples with only a small percentage of abnormal or interesting examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitvity of a classier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are now regarded as a potential solution to revive the traditional methods of antibiotic development, although, until now, many AMPs have failed in clinical trials. A comprehensive database of AMPs with information about their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity will help promote the process of finding novel AMPs with improved antimicrobial activity and reduced cytotoxicity and eventually accelerate the speed of translating the discovery of new AMPs into clinical or preclinical trials. LAMP, a database linking AMPs, serves as a tool to aid the discovery and design of AMPs as new antimicrobial agents. The current version of LAMP has 5,547 entries, comprising 3,904 natural AMPs and 1,643 synthetic peptides. The database can be queried using either simply keywords or combinatorial conditions searches. Equipped with the detailed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity data, the cross-linking and top similar AMPs functions implemented in LAMP will help enhance our current understanding of AMPs and this may speed up the development of new AMPs for medical applications.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The limited availability of protein structures often restricts the functional annotation of proteins and the identification of their protein-protein interaction sites. Computational methods to identify interaction sites from protein sequences alone are, therefore, required for unraveling the functions of many proteins. This article describes a new method (PSIVER) to predict interaction sites, i.e. residues binding to other proteins, in protein sequences. Only sequence features (position-specific scoring matrix and predicted accessibility) are used for training a Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and conditional probabilities of each sequence feature are estimated using a kernel density estimation method (KDE). RESULTS: The leave-one out cross-validation of PSIVER achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.151, an F-measure of 35.3{\%}, a precision of 30.6{\%} and a recall of 41.6{\%} on a non-redundant set of 186 protein sequences extracted from 105 heterodimers in the Protein Data Bank (consisting of 36 219 residues, of which 15.2{\%} were known interface residues). Even though the dataset used for training was highly imbalanced, a randomization test demonstrated that the proposed method managed to avoid overfitting. PSIVER was also tested on 72 sequences not used in training (consisting of 18 140 residues, of which 10.6{\%} were known interface residues), and achieved an MCC of 0.135, an F-measure of 31.5{\%}, a precision of 25.0{\%} and a recall of 46.5{\%}, outperforming other publicly available servers tested on the same dataset. PSIVER enables experimental biologists to identify potential interface residues in unknown proteins from sequence information alone, and to mutate those residues selectively in order to unravel protein functions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides are a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Plants are an important source of such peptides; their pharmacological properties are known since antiquity. Access to relevant information, however, is not straightforward, as there are practically no major repositories of experimentally validated and/or predicted plant antimicrobial peptides. PhytAMP is the only database dedicated to plant peptides with confirmed antimicrobial action, holding 273 entries. Data on such peptides can be otherwise retrieved from generic repositories. DESCRIPTION: We present C-PAmP, a database of computationally predicted plant antimicrobial peptides. C-PAmP contains 15,174,905 peptides, 5-100 amino acids long, derived from 33,877 proteins of 2,112 plant species in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Its web interface allows queries based on peptide/protein sequence, protein accession number and species. Users can view the corresponding predicted peptides along with their probability score, their classification according to the Collection of Anti-Microbial Peptides (CAMP), and their PhytAMP id where applicable. Moreover, users can visualise protein regions with a high concentration of predicted antimicrobial peptides. In order to identify potential antimicrobial peptides we used a classification algorithm, based on a modified version of the pseudo amino acid concept. The classifier tested all subsequences ranging from 5 to 100 amino acids of the plant proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and stored those classified as antimicrobial with a high probability score ({\textgreater}90{\%}). Its performance measures across a 10-fold cross-validation are more than satisfactory (accuracy: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 0.90) and it succeeded in classifying 99.5{\%} of the PhytAMP peptides correctly. CONCLUSIONS: We have compiled a major repository of predicted plant antimicrobial peptides using a highly performing classification algorithm. Our repository is accessible from the web and supports multiple querying options to optimise data retrieval. We hope it will greatly benefit drug design research by significantly limiting the range of plant peptides to be experimentally tested for antimicrobial activity.},

abstract = {Apoptosis proteins have a central role in the development and homeostasis of an organism. These proteins are very important for understanding the mechanism of programmed cell death. As a result of genome and other sequencing projects, the gap between the number of known apoptosis protein sequences and the number of known apoptosis protein structures is widening rapidly. Because of this extremely unbalanced state, it would be worthwhile to develop a fast and reliable method to identify their subcellular locations so as to gain better insight into their biological functions. In view of this, a new method, in which the support vector machine combines with discrete wavelet transform, has been developed to predict the subcellular location of apoptosis proteins. The results obtained by the jackknife test were quite promising, and indicated that the proposed method can remarkably improve the prediction accuracy of subcellular locations, and might also become a useful high-throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily according to their sequences.},

abstract = {The knowledge of subnuclear localization in eukaryotic cells is essential for understanding the life function of nucleus. Developing prediction methods and tools for proteins subnuclear localization become important research fields in protein science for special characteristics in cell nuclear. In this study, a novel approach has been proposed to predict protein subnuclear localization. Sample of protein is represented by Pseudo Amino Acid (PseAA) composition based on approximate entropy (ApEn) concept, which reflects the complexity of time series. A novel ensemble classifier is designed incorporating three AdaBoost classifiers. The base classifier algorithms in three AdaBoost are decision stumps, fuzzy K nearest neighbors classifier, and radial basis-support vector machines, respectively. Different PseAA compositions are used as input data of different AdaBoost classifier in ensemble. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the dimension and weight factor of PseAA composition. Two datasets often used in published works are used to validate the performance of the proposed approach. The obtained results of Jackknife cross-validation test are higher and more balance than them of other methods on same datasets. The promising results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and practical. It might become a useful tool in protein subnuclear localization.

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease prevalent in population and is not easily perceived in its initial stage but may sway a patient very seriously in later stage. In accordance with the estimation of World Health Organization (WHO), there will be 370 million diabetics which are 5.4{\%} of the global people in 2030, so it becomes more and more important to predict whether a pregnant woman has or is likely to acquire diabetes. This study is conducted with the use of the machine learning-Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)-to assist doctors in predicting pregnant women who have premonition of type 2 diabetes. AIRS is proposed by Andrew Watkins in 2001 and it makes use of the metaphor of the vertebrate immune system to recognize antigens, select clone, and memorize cells. Additionally, AIRS includes a mechanism, limited resource, to restrain the number of memory cells from increasing uncontrollably. It has also showed positive results on problems in which it was applied. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility in using AIRS to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) subsequent DM. The dataset of diabetes has imbalanced data, but the overall classification recall could still reach 62.8{\%}, which is better than the traditional method, logistic regression, and the technique which is thought as one of the powerful classification approaches, support vector machines (SVM).},

abstract = {Local SVM is a classification approach that, combines instance-based learning and statistical machine learning. It builds an SVM on the feature space neighborhood of the query point in the training set and uses it to predict its class. There, is both empirical and theoretical evidence that Local SVM call improve over SVM and kNN in terms of classification accuracy, but the computational cost of the method permits the application only on small datasets. Here, we propose FastLSVM, a classifier based on Local SVM that decreases the number of SVMs that, must be built in order to be suitable for large dataset's. FastLSVM precomputes a set, of local SVMs in the training set and assigns to each model all the points lying in the central neighborhood of the k points oil which it, is trained. The prediction is performed applying to the query point the model corresponding to its nearest neighbor in the training set. The empirical evaluation we provide points out, that FastLSVM is a good approximation of Local SVM and its computational performances oil big datasets (a large artificial problem with 100000 samples and a very large real problem with more than 500000 samples) dramatically ameliorate performances of SVM and it's fast, existing approximations improving also the generalization accuracies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent techniques for tagging and visualizing single molecules in fixed or living organisms and cell lines have been revolutionizing our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of fundamental biological processes. However, fluorescence microscopy images are often noisy, and it can be difficult to distinguish a fluorescently labeled single molecule from background speckle. RESULTS: We present a computational pipeline to distinguish the true signal of fluorescently labeled molecules from background fluorescence and noise. We test our technique using the challenging case of wide-field, epifluorescence microscope image stacks from single molecule fluorescence in situ experiments on nematode embryos where there can be substantial out-of-focus light and structured noise. The software recognizes and classifies individual mRNA spots by measuring several features of local intensity maxima and classifying them with a supervised random forest classifier. A key innovation of this software is that, by estimating the probability that each local maximum is a true spot in a statistically principled way, it makes it possible to estimate the error introduced by image classification. This can be used to assess the quality of the data and to estimate a confidence interval for the molecule count estimate, all of which are important for quantitative interpretations of the results of single-molecule experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The software classifies spots in these images well, with {\textgreater}95{\%} AUROC on realistic artificial data and outperforms other commonly used techniques on challenging real data. Its interval estimates provide a unique measure of the quality of an image and confidence in the classification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA-binding proteins are vital for the study of cellular processes. In recent genome engineering studies, the identification of proteins with certain functions has become increasingly important and needs to be performed rapidly and efficiently. In previous years, several approaches have been developed to improve the identification of DNA-binding proteins. However, the currently available resources are insufficient to accurately identify these proteins. Because of this, the previous research has been limited by the relatively unbalanced accuracy rate and the low identification success of the current methods. RESULTS: In this paper, we explored the practicality of modelling DNA binding identification and simultaneously employed an ensemble classifier, and a new predictor (nDNA-Prot) was designed. The presented framework is comprised of two stages: a 188-dimension feature extraction method to obtain the protein structure and an ensemble classifier designated as imDC. Experiments using different datasets showed that our method is more successful than the traditional methods in identifying DNA-binding proteins. The identification was conducted using a feature that selected the minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR). An accuracy rate of 95.80{\%} and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.986 were obtained in a cross validation. A test dataset was tested in our method and resulted in an 86{\%} accuracy, versus a 76{\%} using iDNA-Prot and a 68{\%} accuracy using DNA-Prot. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can help to accurately identify DNA-binding proteins, and the web server is accessible at http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/{\~{}}songli/nDNA. In addition, we also predicted possible DNA-binding protein sequences in all of the sequences from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach. RESULTS: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods have been implemented in R package seqlm that is available through Github: https://github.com/raivokolde/seqlm CONTACT: rkolde@gmail.com SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens heightens the need to design new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit broad-spectrum potent activity against MDR pathogens and kills rapidly, thus giving rise to AMPs being recognized as a potential substitute for conventional antibiotics. Designing new AMPs using current in-silico approaches is, however, challenging due to the absence of suitable models, large number of design parameters, testing cycles, production time and cost. To date, AMPs have merely been categorized into families according to their primary sequences, structures and functions. The ability to computationally determine the properties that discriminate AMP families from each other could help in exploring the key characteristics of these families and facilitate the in-silico design of synthetic AMPs. RESULTS: Here we studied 14 AMP families and sub-families. We selected a specific description of AMP amino acid sequence and identified compositional and physicochemical properties of amino acids that accurately distinguish each AMP family from all other AMPs with an average sensitivity, specificity and precision of 92.88{\%}, 99.86{\%} and 95.96{\%}, respectively. Many of our identified discriminative properties have been shown to be compositional or functional characteristics of the corresponding AMP family in literature. We suggest that these properties could serve as guides for in-silico methods in design of novel synthetic AMPs. The methodology we developed is generic and has a potential to be applied for characterization of any protein family.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibacterial peptides are important components of the innate immune system, used by the host to protect itself from different types of pathogenic bacteria. Over the last few decades, the search for new drugs and drug targets has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. We analyzed 486 antibacterial peptides, obtained from antimicrobial peptide database APD, in order to understand the preference of amino acid residues at specific positions in these peptides. RESULTS: It was observed that certain types of residues are preferred over others in antibacterial peptides, particularly at the N and C terminus. These observations encouraged us to develop a method for predicting antibacterial peptides in proteins from their amino acid sequence. First, the N-terminal residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptides using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quantitative Matrices (QM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which resulted in an accuracy of 83.63{\%}, 84.78{\%} and 87.85{\%}, respectively. Then, the C-terminal residues were used for developing prediction methods, which resulted in an accuracy of 77.34{\%}, 82.03{\%} and 85.16{\%} using ANN, QM and SVM, respectively. Finally, ANN, QM and SVM models were developed using N and C terminal residues, which achieved an accuracy of 88.17{\%}, 90.37{\%} and 92.11{\%}, respectively. All the models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. These models were also tested on an independent or blind dataset. CONCLUSION: Among antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C termini, which helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Both the termini play a crucial role in imparting the antibacterial property to these peptides. Among the methods developed, SVM shows the best performance in predicting antibacterial peptides followed by QM and ANN, in that order. AntiBP (Antibacterial peptides) will help in discovering efficacious antibacterial peptides, which we hope will prove to be a boon to combat the dreadful antibiotic resistant bacteria. A user friendly web server has also been developed to help the biological community, which is accessible at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/antibp/.},

abstract = {Protein stability, folding and unfolding rates are all determined by the multidimensional folding free energy surface, which in turn is dictated by factors such as size, structure, and amino-acid sequence. Work over the last 15 years has highlighted the role of size and 3D structure in determining folding rates, resulting in many procedures for their prediction. In contrast, unfolding rates are thought to depend on sequence specifics and be much more difficult to predict. Here we introduce a minimalist physics-based model that computes one-dimensional folding free energy surfaces using the number of aminoacids (N) and the structural class (alpha-helical, all-beta, or alpha-beta) as only protein-specific input. In this model N sets the overall cost in conformational entropy and the net stabilization energy, whereas the structural class defines the partitioning of the stabilization energy between local and non-local interactions. To test its predictive power, we calibrated the model empirically and implemented it into an algorithm for the PREdiction of Folding and Unfolding Rates (PREFUR). We found that PREFUR predicts the absolute folding and unfolding rates of an experimental database of 52 proteins with accuracies of +/-0.7 and +/-1.4 orders of magnitude, respectively (relative to experimental spans of 6 and 8 orders of magnitude). Such prediction uncertainty for proteins vastly varying in size and structure is only two-fold larger than the differences in folding (+/-0.34) and unfolding rates (+/-0.7) caused by single-point mutations. Moreover, PREFUR predicts protein stability with an accuracy of +/-6.3 kJ mol(-1), relative to the 5 kJ mol(-1) average perturbation induced by single-point mutations. The remarkable performance of our simplistic model demonstrates that size and structural class are the major determinants of the folding landscapes of natural proteins, whereas sequence variability only provides the final 10-20{\%} tuning. PREFUR is thus a powerful bioinformatic tool for the prediction of folding properties and analysis of experimental data.},

abstract = {Prototype Selection (PS) algorithms allow a faster Nearest Neighbor classification by keeping only the most profitable prototypes of the training set. In turn, these schemes typically lower the performance accuracy. In this work a new strategy for multi-label classifications tasks is proposed to solve this accuracy drop without the need of using all the training set. For that, given a new instance, the PS algorithm is used as a fast recommender system which retrieves the most likely classes. Then, the actual classification is performed only considering the prototypes from the initial training set belonging to the suggested classes. Results show that this strategy provides a large set of trade-off solutions which fills the gap between PS-based classification efficiency and conventional kNN accuracy. Furthermore, this scheme is not only able to, at best, reach the performance of conventional kNN with barely a third of distances computed, but it does also outperform the latter in noisy scenarios, proving to be a much more robust approach.

abstract = {Motivation: Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process that directs the generation of different transcripts from single genes. A computational model that can accurately predict splicing patterns based on genomic features and cellular context is highly desirable, both in understanding this widespread phenomenon, and in exploring the effects of genetic variations on AS. Methods: Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. Results: We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the genomic features is presented.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is crucial for understanding its functions. The subcellular pattern of a protein is typically represented as the set of cellular components in which it is located, and an important task is to determine this set from microscope images. In this article, we address this classification problem using confocal immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project. The HPA contains images of cells stained for many proteins; each is also stained for three reference components, but there are many other components that are invisible. Given one such cell, the task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein. We first randomly select local image regions within the cells, and then extract various carefully designed features from these regions. This region-based approach enables us to explicitly study the relationship between proteins and different cell components, as well as the interactions between these components. To achieve these two goals, we propose two discriminative models that extend logistic regression with structured latent variables. The first model allows the same protein pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying components in different regions. The second model further captures the spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that we can better infer these components. To learn these models, we propose a fast approximate algorithm for inference, and then use gradient-based methods to maximize the data likelihood. RESULTS: In the experiments, we show that the proposed models help improve the classification accuracies on synthetic data and real cellular images. The best overall accuracy we report in this article for classifying 942 proteins into 13 classes of patterns is about 84.6{\%}, which to our knowledge is the best so far. In addition, the dependencies learned are consistent with prior knowledge of cell organization. AVAILABILITY: http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/.

The sequence representation are categorized into 6 groups: primary sequence based, evolutionary profile based, predicted secondary structure based, predicted relative solvent accessibility based, physicochemical property based and biological function based features. The mRMR, wrapper and two-stage feature selection methods are employed for removing irrelevant features and reducing redundant features. Experiments demonstrate that the two-stage method performs better than the mRMR and wrapper methods. We also perform a statistical analysis on the selected features and results show that more than 95{\%} of the selected features are statistically significant and they cover all 6 feature groups. The newDNA-Prot method is compared with several state of the art algorithms, including iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot. The results demonstrate that newDNA-Prot method outperforms the iDNA-Prot, DNAbinder and DNA-Prot methods. More specific, newDNA-Prot improves the runner-up method, DNA-Prot for around 10{\%} on several evaluation measures.

These include host-defense peptides with cytotoxic activities against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and mammalian cells. Several hundred such peptides from diverse species have been described. Although attention has been focused mainly on antimicrobial activity, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents remains to be realized and no compound based upon their structures has yet been adopted in clinical practice. Consequently, alternative applications are being explored. Certain naturally occurring frog skin peptides, and analogs with improved therapeutic properties, show selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells and viruses and so have potential for development into anti-cancer and anti-viral agents. Some peptides display complex cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties. Effects on the production of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines by peritoneal macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been observed so that clinical applications as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory agents are possible. Several frog skin peptides, first identified on the basis of antimicrobial activity, have been shown to stimulate insulin release both in vitro and in vivo and so show potential as incretin-based therapies for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review assesses the therapeutic possibilities of peptides from frogs belonging to the Ascaphidae, Alytidae, Pipidae, Dicroglossidae, Leptodactylidae, Hylidae, and Ranidae families that complement their potential role as anti-infectives for use against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.},

However, there are far few computational models for predicting plant protein subcellular multi-localization. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for predicting multiple subcellular locations of plant proteins (MLMK-TLM). The method proposes a multi-label confusion matrix and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which we further extend our published work MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for plant protein subcellular multi-localization. By proper homolog knowledge transfer, MLMK-TLM is applicable to novel plant protein subcellular localization in multi-label learning scenario. The experiments on plant protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM outperforms the baseline model. Unlike the existing models, MLMK-TLM also reports its misleading tendency, which is important for comprehensive survey of model's multi-labeling performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Motivation: Computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction play important roles in protein function studies and experimental design. Most existing methods are based on feature extraction, which may result in incomplete or biased features. Deep learning as the cutting-edge machine learning method has the ability to automatically discover complex representations of phosphorylation patterns from the raw sequences, and hence it provides a powerful tool for improvement of phosphorylation site prediction. Results: We present MusiteDeep, the first deep-learning framework for predicting general and kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. MusiteDeep takes raw sequence data as input and uses convolutional neural networks with a novel two-dimensional attention mechanism. It achieves over a 50{\%} relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve in general phosphorylation site prediction and obtains competitive results in kinase-specific prediction compared to other well-known tools on the benchmark data.

abstract = {Background: RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and secondary structure specificities is challenging for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs detection. Results: In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. Conclusion: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.},
