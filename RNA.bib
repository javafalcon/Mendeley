abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many fundamental biological processes essential for cellular function. Most of the existing computational approaches employed only the sequence context of the target residue for its prediction. In the present study, for each target residue, we applied both the spatial context and the sequence context to construct the feature space. Subsequently, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was applied to remove the redundancies in the feature space. Finally, a predictor (PDNAsite) was developed through the integration of the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and ensemble learning. Results on the PDNA-62 and the PDNA-224 datasets demonstrate that features extracted from spatial context provide more information than those from sequence context and the combination of them gives more performance gain. An analysis of the number of binding sites in the spatial context of the target site indicates that the interactions between binding sites next to each other are important for protein-DNA recognition and their binding ability. The comparison between our proposed PDNAsite method and the existing methods indicate that PDNAsite outperforms most of the existing methods and is a useful tool for DNA-binding site identification. A web-server of our predictor (http://hlt.hitsz.edu.cn:8080/PDNAsite/) is made available for free public accessible to the biological research community.},

abstract = {As one of the most ubiquitous post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays an essential role in many vital biological processes. The identification of m6A sites in RNAs is significantly important for both basic biomedical research and practical drug development. In this study, we designed a computational-based method, called TargetM6A, to rapidly and accurately target m6A sites solely from the primary RNA sequences. Two new features, i.e., position-specific nucleotide/dinucleotide propensities (PSNP/PSDP), are introduced and combined with the traditional nucleotide composition (NC) feature to formulate RNA sequences. The extracted features are further optimized to obtain a much more compact and discriminative feature subset by applying an incremental feature selection (IFS) procedure. Based on the optimized feature subset, we trained TargetM6A on the training dataset with a support vector machine (SVM) as the prediction engine. We compared the proposed TargetM6A method with existing methods for predicting m6A sites by performing stringent jackknife tests and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Target M6A method outperformed the existing methods for predicting m6A sites and remarkably improved the prediction performances, with MCC = 0.526 and AUC = 0.818. We also provided a user-friendly web server for TargetM6A, which is publicly accessible for academic use at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/TargetM6A.},

@article{Legendre2018,
abstract = {Background: RNA structure prediction is an important field in bioinformatics, and numerous methods and tools have been proposed. Pseudoknots are specific motifs of RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure. Results: We propose here an original method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of RNA secondary structure prediction, namely MEA and MFE. The resulting tool, called BiokoP, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F1-score) is, in most cases, given by BiokoP. Moreover, the results of BiokoP are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F1-scores are always higher than 70{\%} for any number of solutions returned. Conclusion: The results obtained by BiokoP show that combining the MEA and the MFE models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the MEA and the MFE models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models. BiokoP is available on the EvryRNA platform: https://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.},

abstract = {As many structures of protein-DNA complexes have been known in the past years, several computational methods have been developed to predict DNA-binding sites in proteins. However, its inverse problem (i.e., predicting protein-binding sites in DNA) has received much less attention. One of the reasons is that the differences between the interaction propensities of nucleotides are much smaller than those between amino acids. Another reason is that DNA exhibits less diverse sequence patterns than protein. Therefore, predicting protein-binding DNA nucleotides is much harder than predicting DNA-binding amino acids. We computed the interaction propensity (IP) of nucleotide triplets with amino acids using an extensive dataset of protein-DNA complexes, and developed two support vector machine (SVM) models that predict protein-binding nucleotides from sequence data alone. One SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using DNA sequence data alone, and the other SVM model predicts protein-binding nucleotides using both DNA and protein sequences. In a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences, the SVM model that uses DNA sequence data only predicted protein-binding nucleotides with an accuracy of 67.0{\%}, an F-measure of 67.1{\%}, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.340. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs that were not used in training, it achieved an accuracy of 66.2{\%}, an F-measure 66.3{\%} and a MCC of 0.324. Another SVM model that uses both DNA and protein sequences achieved an accuracy of 69.6{\%}, an F-measure of 69.6{\%}, and a MCC of 0.383 in a 10-fold cross-validation with 1519 DNA sequences and 859 protein sequences. With an independent dataset of 181 DNAs and 143 proteins, it showed an accuracy of 67.3{\%}, an F-measure of 66.5{\%} and a MCC of 0.329. Both in cross-validation and independent testing, the second SVM model that used both DNA and protein sequence data showed better performance than the first model that used DNA sequence data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict protein-binding nucleotides in a given DNA sequence from the sequence data alone.},

abstract = {Nearest-neighbor (NN) rules provide a simple and powerful quantitative framework for RNA structure prediction that is strongly supported for canonical Watson-Crick duplexes from a plethora of thermodynamic measurements. Predictions of RNA secondary structure based on nearest-neighbor (NN) rules are routinely used to understand biological function and to engineer and control new functions in biotechnology. However, NN applications to RNA structural features such as internal and terminal loops rely on approximations and assumptions, with sparse experimental coverage of the vast number of possible sequence and structural features. To test to what extent NN rules accurately predict thermodynamic stabilities across RNAs with non-WC features, we tested their predictions using a quantitative high-throughput assay platform, RNA-MaP. Using a thermodynamic assay with coupled protein binding, we carried out equilibrium measurements for over 1000 RNAs with a range of predicted secondary structure stabilities. Our results revealed substantial scatter and systematic deviations between NN predictions and observed stabilities. Solution salt effects and incorrect or omitted loop parameters contribute to these observed deviations. Our results demonstrate the need to independently and quantitatively test NN computational algorithms to identify their capabilities and limitations. RNA-MaP and related approaches can be used to test computational predictions and can be adapted to obtain experimental data to improve RNA secondary structure and other prediction algorithms.

Significance statement RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are routinely used to understand, predict and design functional RNA structures in biology and biotechnology. Given the vast number of RNA sequence and structural features, these predictions rely on a series of approximations, and independent tests are needed to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of predicted RNA structural stabilities. Here we measure the stabilities of over 1000 RNA constructs by using a coupled protein binding assay. Our results reveal substantial deviations from the RNA stabilities predicted by popular algorithms, and identify factors contributing to the observed deviations. We demonstrate the importance of quantitative, experimental tests of computational RNA structure predictions and present an approach that can be used to routinely test and improve the prediction accuracy.},

@article{Wheeler2018,
abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in determining cellular behavior by manipulating the processing of target RNAs. Robust methods are required to detect the numerous binding sites of RBPs across the transcriptome. RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) and crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) are state-of-the-art methods used to identify the RNA targets and specific binding sites of RBPs. Historically, CLIP methods have been confounded with challenges such as the requirement for tens of millions of cells per experiment, low RNA yields resulting in libraries that contain a high number of polymerase chain reaction duplicated reads, and technical inconveniences such as radioactive labeling of RNAs. However, recent improvements in the recovery of bound RNAs and the efficiency of converting isolated RNAs into a library for sequencing have enhanced our ability to perform the experiment at scale, from less starting material than has previously been possible, and resulting in high quality datasets for the confident identification of protein binding sites. These, along with additional improvements to protein capture, removal of nonspecific signals, and methods to isolate noncanonical RBP targets have revolutionized the study of RNA processing regulation, and reveal a promising future for mapping the human protein-RNA regulatory network.

@article{Sato2005,
abstract = {Motivation: The computational identification of non-coding RNA regions on the genome is currently receiving much attention. However, it is essentially harder than gene-finding problems for protein-coding regions because non-coding RNA sequences do not have strong statistical signals. Since comparative sequence analysis is effective for non-coding RNA detection, efficient computational methods are expected for structural alignment of RNA sequences. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish the structural alignment tasks for RNA sequences, and we found that one of the most important points is to estimate an accurate score matrix for calculating structural alignments. Results: We propose a novel approach for RNA structural alignment based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach has some specific features compared with previous methods in the sense that the parameters for structural alignment are estimated such that the model can most probably discriminate between correct alignments and incorrect alignments, and has the generalization ability so that a satisfiable score matrix can be obtained even with a small number of sample data without overfitting. Experimental results clearly show that the parameter estimation with CRFs can outperform all the other existing methods for structural alignments of RNA sequences. Furthermore, structural alignment search based on CRFs is more accurate for predicting non-coding RNA regions than the other scoring methods. These experimental results strongly support our discriminative method employing CRFs to estimate the score matrix parameters. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {The secondary structure of an RNA is often implicit to its function. Recently, various high-throughput RNA structure probing techniques have been developed to elucidate important RNA structure–function relationships genome-wide. These techniques produce unwieldy experimental data sets that require evaluation with unique computational pipelines. Herein, we present StructureFold2, a user-friendly set of analysis tools that makes precise data processing and detailed downstream analyses of such data sets both available and practical. StructureFold2 processes high-throughput reads sequenced from libraries prepared after experimental probing for reverse transcription (RT) stops generated by chemical modification of RNA at solvent accessible residues. This pipeline is able to analyze reads generated from a variety of structure-probing chemicals (e.g. DMS, glyoxal, SHAPE). Notably, StructureFold2 offers a new fully featured suite of utilities and tools to guide a user through multiple types of analyses. A particular emphasis is placed on analyzing the reactivity patterns of transcripts, complementing their use as folding restraints for predicting RNA secondary structure. StructureFold2 is hosted as a Github repository and is available at (https://github.com/StructureFold2/StructureFold2).},
